"10 weeks of heavy strength training improves performance-related measurements in elite cyclists.","Rønnestad, Bent R.; Hansen, Joar; Nygaard, Håvard","Journal of Sports Sciences",="02640414",,="20170715","35","14","1435","7","122658189",,,"Article","AEROBIC exercises; ATHLETIC ability; CYCLING; EXERCISE; MUSCLE strength; PHYSICAL fitness; ELITE athletes",,"Elite cyclists have often a limited period of time available during their short preparation phase to focus on development of maximal strength; therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 10-week heavy strength training on lean lower-body mass, leg strength, determinants of cycling performance and cycling performance in elite cyclists. Twelve cyclists performed heavy strength training and normal endurance training (E&S) while 8 other cyclists performed normal endurance training only (E). Following the intervention period E&S had a larger increase in maximal isometric half squat, mean power output during a 30-s Wingate sprint (P < 0.05) and a tendency towards larger improvement in power output at 4 mmol ∙ L−1[la−] than E (P = 0.068). There were no significant difference between E&S and E in changes in 40-min all-out trial (4 ± 6% vs. −1 ± 6%, respectively,P = 0.13). These beneficial effects may encourage elite cyclists to perform heavy strength training and the short period of only 10 weeks should make it executable even in the compressed training and competition schedule of elite cyclists.

Exercise training can improve muscular strength in breast cancer survivors (BCS), even without skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Factors such as improved muscle quality (MQ) may contribute to improved function but limited data are available in BCS. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of exercise training in BCS and healthy controls (HC) on MQ, cross-sectional area (CSA), muscular strength, and physical function and to examine associations between these measures. METHODS: BCS (n=31, 54 [11] y, 27.5 [5.0] kg/m²) and HC (n=15, 54 [8] y, 29.3 [4.9] kg/m²) underwent a 16-week combined aerobic and strength training intervention 3x/week for one-hour at a community-based exercise program for BCS. Isokinetic peak torque and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) were assessed in the knee extensor muscles. Ultrasound was used to determine muscle CSA and echo intensity of the vastus lateralis. Functional parameters included 6-minute walk (6MWT) and timed up and go (TUG). All measures were taken pre- and post-intervention and were analyzed using a 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA and Pearson's correlations. Data are mean change [SD]. RESULTS: Echo intensity decreased with training overall (-5.4 [24.6], p=.046), indicating higher MQ, with no change in CSA. A time x group interaction for MVIC showed increased strength after training in BCS (+11.0 [17.2] N·m, p=.001) but not HC (-2.6 [23.7] N·m, p=.673). Physical function improved in both groups (TUG -0.5 [0.9] sec, p<.000; 6MWT 35.5 [45.0] m, p<.001). At baseline, echo intensity was inversely correlated with MVIC, TUG and 6MWT in HC only (r= -0.451-0.490, all p<0.05). No associations in the changes of these variables were observed with training. CONCLUSION: A 16-week exercise intervention improved MQ and functional measures in both BCS and HC, while MVIC increased only in BCS. MQ was moderately correlated with functional and strength measures at baseline in HC but not in BCS. The lack of correlations in BCS suggest that other factors, possibly neural adaptations, may be responsible for the improvements in muscular strength and functional measures seen after an exercise intervention rather than improvements in MQ and CSA.

Fibromyalgia is a common musculoskeletal disorder characterized by widespread chronic pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, depression or anxiety and cognitive alterations. It has several therapy options, physical exercise being one of the most recommended. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a combined training program on pain and associated symptoms in fibromyalgia patients. Methods The study included 34 patients who underwent a 12-week physical training program. The program included 3 weeks of flexibility exercises, 3 weeks of postural hygiene and balance exercises, 3 weeks of aerobic exercises and 3 weeks of Pilates. We monitored the number of tender points, pain rated by the patient and measured with a digital algometer in 6 points of the body, level of anxiety and depression and disease impact. All the parameters were evaluated before and after the program, as well as 4 months after the program was over. Results: The average number of tender points dropped from an initial 12 to 5.6, scores for pain registered a 43% decrease and disease impact diminished from 53.1 to 39.1 (p<0.001). The pain threshold indicated by the algometer improved on all measured points. Positive results in these parameters were still observed at follow-up. No significant results were found for depression and anxiety. Conclusion: a mixed training program improves the level of pain, number of tender points, disease impact and quality of life in fibromyalgia patients.

However, a phenomenon called ""Concurrent training effect"" (CTE), which is a compromise in adaptation resulting from concurrent training, appears to be mostly affected by the interference of the molecular pathways of the underlying adaptations from each type of training segments. Until now, it seems that the volume, intensity, type, frequency of endurance training, as well as the training history and background strongly affect the CTE. High volume, moderate, continuous and frequent endurance training, are thought to negatively affect the resistance training-induced adaptations, probably by inhibition of the Protein kinase B—mammalian target of rapamycin pathway activation, of the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In contrast, it seems that short bouts of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or sprint interval training (SIT) minimize the negative effects of concurrent training. This is particularly the case when HIIT and SIT incorporated in cycling have even lower or even no negative effects, while they provide at least the same metabolic adaptations, probably through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC-1a) pathway. However, significant questions about the molecular events underlying the CTE remain unanswered.

"A BRIEF REVIEW.","WILLARDSON, JEFFREY M.","Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research",="10648011",,="20061101","20","4","978","7","113579473",,,"Article",,,"Research has indicated that multiple sets are superior to single sets for maximal strength development. However, whether maximal strength gains are achieved may depend on the ability to sustain a consistent number of repetitions over consecutive sets. A key factor that determines the ability to sustain repetitions is the length of rest interval between sets. The length of the rest interval is commonly prescribed based on the training goal, but may vary based on several other factors. The purpose of this review was to discuss these factors in the context of different training goals. When training for muscular strength, the magnitude of the load lifted is a key determinant of the rest interval prescribed between sets. For loads less than 90% of 1 repetition maximum, 3-5 minutes rest between sets allows for greater strength increases through the maintenance of training intensity. However, when testing for maximal strength, 1-2 minutes rest between sets might be sufficient between repeated attempts. When training for muscular power, a minimum of 3 minutes rest should be prescribed between sets of repeated maximal effort movements (e.g., plyometric jumps). When training for muscular hypertrophy, consecutive sets should be performed prior to when full recovery has taken place. Shorter rest intervals of 30-60 seconds between sets have been associated with higher acute increases in growth hormone, which may contribute to the hypertrophic effect. When training for muscular endurance, an ideal strategy might be to perform resistance exercises in a circuit, with shorter rest intervals (e.g., 30 seconds) between exercises that involve dissimilar muscle groups, and longer rest intervals (e.g., 3 minutes) between exercises that involve similar muscle groups. In summary, the length of the rest interval between sets is only 1 component of a resistance exercise program directed toward different training goals. Prescribing the appropriate rest interval does not ensure a desired outcome if other components such as intensity and volume are not prescribed appropriately.

Effects of resistance training and plyometric training may actually be synergistic, with their combined effects being greater than each program performed alone. Aims: This randomized controlled study aimed to compare the effects of an 8-week training period of combined plyometric and resistance training with resistance training alone on fitness performance in boys. Methods: Participants (24 boys, 12–14 years) were randomly assigned to an 8-week combined training group (CT, n = 12) that performed plyometric exercises (~ 20 min.) followed by resistance training or a resistance training group (RT, n = 12) that performed static stretching exercises (~ 20 min.) followed by the same resistance training program. Both groups performed twice weekly training sessions of 90 min. At baseline and after training all participants were tested on the 20-m sprint (time) and Squat Jump (power, velocity, force and height). Results: The CT group showed significantly (p < 0.05) improvement than RT in the 20-m sprint time (− 0.07 vs. 0.05 s), and Squat Jump (Power: 159.0 vs. − 5.0 W; velocity: 0.2 vs. − 0.2 m s−1; force: 41.2 vs. − 57.4 N; height: 10.6 vs. − 0.3 cm) following training. Conclusions: Results suggest that when seeking to induce specific acute adaptations in vertical jump and acceleration capacities in lower limbs, male adolescents may benefit more from exposure to a combination of plyometric and resistance training methods.

There are contradictory studies about the effects of exercise training on PON1 levels. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of endurance or resistance exercise training on PON1 and lipid profile levels in obese men. Methods: Twenty-six obese men, were divided into three groups: endurance training ( n = 9), resistance training ( n = 9) and control ( n = 8). Both of the training groups participated in 4 weeks of resistance and endurance training, respectively, with intensity of 65-80 % maximum heart rate and 60-80 % 1RM. Results: After 4 weeks of endurance and resistance training, a significant decrease was observed in weight (respectively, P = 0.010 and P = 0.012) and body fat percentage (respectively, P = 0.006 and P = 0.006), while PON1 levels significantly increased in aerobic groups (296.11 ± 255.3 vs. 342.2 ± 284.6 nmol/l, p = 0.039) and LDL levels (123.55 ± 20.15 vs. 111.33 ± 36.74 mg/dl, p = 0.05) significantly decreased. In contrast, in resistance training and control groups, we did not observe any significant changes in cholesterol, TG, LDL, HDL levels. In addition, a significant correlation was not observed between PON1 levels and anthropometric and metabolic parameters between groups ( p > 0.05). Conclusion: The results of this research indicate that endurance training can be used as an effective factor to reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease in obese men.

Design: Assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial with 12-months follow-up. Setting: Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. Subjects: A total of 164 cardiac patients referred to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation were recruited. Interventions: Patients were randomized to 1-hour exercise sessions either three times weekly for 12 weeks (36 sessions, high-dose group) or twice weekly for 8 weeks (16 sessions, low-dose group). The same standardized exercise and intensity protocol including aerobic and muscle strength training was used in all participants. Main measures: Primary outcome was changes in VO2peak. Secondary outcomes were changes in maximal workload, muscle strength and power. Measures were obtained at baseline, after termination of the rehabilitation programme and at follow-up after 6 and 12 months. Results: After the end of intervention, statistically significant between-group differences were seen in favour of the high-dose group in all outcomes: VO2peak 2.6 (mL kg−1 min−1) (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4–4.8), maximal workload 0.3 W kg−1 (95%CI: 0.02–0.5), isometric muscle strength 0.7 N m kg−1 (95%CI: 0.1–1.2) and muscle power 0.3 W kg−1 (95%CI: 0.04–0.6). After 12 months, a significant between-group difference only persisted in VO2peak and maximal workload. Conclusion: A higher dose of exercise training had a small effect on all outcomes at termination of intervention. A long-term effect persisted in VO2peak and maximal workload. Although the effect was small, it is an important finding because VO2peak is the most important predictor of all-cause mortality in cardiac patients.

Studies have revealed that the anabolic effect of irisin on bone is mediated by an increase in alkaline phosphatase. However, few studies have investigated the interactive effect of irisin on alkaline phosphatase after exercise training. Therefore, the present study aimed to compare the impact of endurance and resistance training protocols on serum irisin concentration and total alkaline phosphatase activity in sedentary obese women. Material and methods. Forty-five sedentary obese women (age: 48.96 ± 5.2 years, body mass index 32.24 ± 3.76 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to control, endurance, and resistance groups. Endurance (45 to 75 minutes at an intensity corresponding to 50 to 80% of heart rate reserve) and resistance exercise training (3 sets, 10-15 repetitions at an intensity corresponding to 50 to 65% of one-repetition maximum) were conducted for 8 weeks, 3 days per week. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) was estimated using the modified Bruce protocol treadmill test. Fasting blood samples were taken before the first and 48-hr after the last exercise training sessions. The serum concentrations of irisin and total alkaline phosphatase activity were measured using the sandwich ELISA method and photo-metric method, respectively. Results. Both endurance and resistance exercise training protocols caused a significant reduction in BMI and BFP of obese women. In contrast, VO2max significantly increased after both exercise training protocols. However, neither endurance nor resistance training protocols had a significant impact on the serum concentrations of irisin and total alkaline phosphatase activity. No significant inter-group differences were observed between the subjects' BMI, BFP, VO2max, total alkaline phosphatase, and irisin at the end of protocols. Conclusions. The finding of the current study revealed that neither of the training protocols had a significant impact on bone anabolic parameters. However, performing these types of exercise is suggested for weight management in obese women.

Methods: A total of 26 professional Australian footballers (23.9 [4.2] y, 189.9 [7.8] cm, 88.2 [8.8] kg) tested 1-repetition-maximum strength (FPmax) and mean barbell velocity at 85% of 1-repetition maximum on floor press (FPvel). They were then assigned to 2 training groups: 20% velocity loss threshold training (VL; n = 12, maximum-effort lift velocity) or training to repetition failure (TF; n = 14, self-selected lift velocity). Subjects trained twice per week for 3 weeks before being reassessed on FPmax and FPvel. Training volume (total repetitions) was recorded for all training sessions. No differences were present between groups on any pretraining measure. Results: The TF group significantly improved FPmax (105.2–110.9 kg, +5.4%), while the VL group did not (107.5–109.2 kg, +1.6%) (P >.05). Both groups significantly increased FPvel (0.38–0.46 m·s−1, +19.1% and 0.37–0.42 m·s−1, +16.7%, respectively) with no between-groups differences evident (P >.05). The TF group performed significantly more training volume (12.2 vs 6.8 repetitions per session, P >.05). Conclusions: Training to repetition failure improved FPmax, while training using a velocity loss threshold of 20% did not. Both groups demonstrated similar improvements in FPvel despite the VL group completing 45% less total training volume than the TF group. The reduction in training volume associated with implementing a 20% velocity loss threshold may negatively impact the development of upper-body maximum strength while still enhancing submaximal movement velocity.

The purpose of this review was to examine only those studies which would allow us to infer the benefits of resistance training on improving time trial performance. Of the nine studies meeting all inclusion criteria only three demonstrated an additive effect of adding resistance training to the current activity-specific training being performed. These three studies demonstrated improvements in either 5 or 10 km time trial among recreationally skilled athletes (i.e. non-elite level time). Previous reviews have included studies which did not include: (1) performance outcomes; (2) control groups; and/or (3) equal volumes of activity-specific exercise among the resistance training and control groups. Presently, there is little evidence that adding resistance exercise to a sport-specific training program will augment time trial performance. While it is difficult to perform such long-term studies assessing the effects of resistance training among time trial athletes, the statement that resistance training is efficacious for improving time trial performance should be tempered until sufficient evidence is presented to support such claims.

Our objective was to critically review the existing evidence regarding this topic. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases primo April 2020, to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of aerobic training, resistance training or concurrent training on brain grey volume changes (by MRI) in adult clinical or healthy elderly populations. Results: A total of 20 articles (from 19 RCTs) evaluating 3–12 months of aerobic, resistance, or concurrent training were identified and included, involving a total of 1662 participants (populations: healthy older adults, older adults with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, adults with schizophrenia or multiple sclerosis or major depression). While few studies indicated a positive effect—although modest—of physical exercise on certain regions of brain grey matter volume, the majority of study findings were neutral (i.e., no effects/small effect sizes) and quite divergent across populations. Meta-analyses showed that different exercise modalities failed to elicit any substantial effects on whole brain grey volume and hippocampus volume, although with rather large confidence interval width (i.e., variability). Conclusion: Altogether, the current evidence on the effects of physical exercise on whole/regional grey matter brain volume appear sparse and inconclusive, and does not support that physical exercise is as potent as previously proposed when it comes to affecting brain grey matter volume.

In addition, it looks at other important factors, such as age, feeding and circadian rhythm which can modify the concentration of testosterone and cortisol acutely thus making it difficult the understanding of the hormonal answers unchained by the training. Although the diverse controversies found in the present study, the periodical and high intensity activities seem to stimulate bigger releases of testosterone and little release of cortisol, contributing , consequently, to the levels of force and muscular hypertrophy. However, new studies need to be carried out with adjusted delineations respecting the diverse interactions (feeding, age, sex, level of experience with the physical training, etc.) that involve the physical training.

Eleven division 1 female soccer players were tested after five predesignated time blocks (B1–B5): post-season 2016 (B1), nine-week transition (B2), spring season (B3), pre-season (B4), and post-season 2017 (B5). Height, weight, and body composition (fat-free mass (FFM)) were measured prior to a standardized 5 min treadmill running and dynamic movement warm up before a maximal AC test. Statistical analysis included a 4 × 5 repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (dependent variable × time) with the Fishers Least Significant Difference (LSD) post-hoc test when relevant; data are presented as mean ± standard deviation, effect size (ES), and percent change (%). The statistical analysis revealed that the ATC had a significant main effect on AC and FFM (F3,4 2.81, p = 0.001; η2 = 0.22). There were significant increases in AC across the transition period (B1–B2) with reduced training volume (∆ + 12.9%, p = 0.001; ES = 0.50) while AC and FFM peaked after the spring season with directed concurrent training paired with adequate rest B1–B3 (∆ + 16.4%, p < 0.01; ES = 0.81). AC decreased across the pre-season with indirect training (B3–B4) (∆ − 7.0%, p = 0.02; ES = 0.50) and remained suppressed without change (p > 0.05) across the competitive season (B4–B5). Rest, concurrent training, and directed training positively affected AC, while indirect training and high training loads with little rest negatively affected AC.

Methods Electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, CNKI et al.) were searched. Methodological quality and publication bias were assessed using Cochrane bias risk assessment tool. Stata 15.1 was used for data analysis. Results A total of 18 articles were included in the meta-analysis with a total sample size of 764. The results from the meta-analysis showed that there was a significant increase in upper body strength, static strength, and lean body mass for the concurrent training group compared to the strength training group. The results of the subgroup analysis revealed that when the training frequency increased from twice a week to three times a week, lean body mass for the concurrent training group was significantly higher than that for the strength training group. When the concurrent training group and the strength training group received the same volume of strength training, the maximum lower body strength of the concurrent training group was significantly higher than that in the strength training group. Conclusions Concurrent training may effectively enhance static strength, dynamic strength, and lean body mass of middle-aged and elderly people, while muscle adaptation does not seem to be affected by endurance training; training frequency does not affect the group difference in lower body strength, while three-time-a-week concurrent training is more effective in reducing body fat. When the total volumes of strength training are equal, concurrent training are more effective in improving lower limb strength in comparison to strength training alone.

METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed using MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science, we identified 175 full-text articles. The methodological quality of the studies, including their risk of bias was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. All analyses were conducted using the random-effects inversevariance model with the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman adjustment. Heterogeneity across trials was calculated using the inconsistency index (I²). RESULTS: The 49 publications included, age ranging from 18 to 78 years (weighted mean: 50.85 years). The assessment of risk of bias showed a mean PEDro score of 6.6 (SD 1.1), indicating consistent methodological quality and a low risk of most biases, except blinding. Compared with the control conditions, exercise training programs were associated with significant reductions in fatigue (d= -0.47, I²=69.8%), and anxiety levels (d=-0.22, I²=53.0%). Concomitant concurrent training, at moderate-to-vigorous intensity, and with a volume ≥150 min/week had benefits on fatigue (d=-0.59, 95%CI -0.79 to -0.38; I²= 62.5%). Exercise programs that met ≥150 min of physical activity per week favored higher reductions in fatigue (d=-0.65, 95%CI -0.93 to -0.38; I²= 76.3%). Also, moderate intensity training also favored significant effects on anxiety (d= -0.47, 95%CI -0.72 to -0.22; I²= 0%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first meta-analytic approach to quantitatively synthesize the effects of supervised exercise interventions on fatigue and anxiety levels in women with breast cancer during active treatment. Further studies are needed with rigorous methodology design and greater sample sizes that take into consideration different methods to study the mental wellbeing effects of exercise interventions.

A number of different exercise interventions have been undertaken to improve knee alignment during functional tasks. The most successful of these interventions are multi-modal incorporating both strength and jump–landing training. Little research has been undertaken to compare these elements individually to assess if success is due to an individual element or the training as a whole. The study assessed the between group effects of strength training or jump–landing training alone on knee valgus alignment during a number of functional tasks, using a cohort specific treatment superiority design. Thirty asymptomatic female participants undertook a 6 week (minimum 15 sessions) strength or jump–landing programme, the effects of which were examined by assessing for any change in frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) during single leg squat and landing and bilateral drop jump landing. Both training methods had positive effects of FPPA during some but not all of the tasks. Strength training brought about significant changes in FPPA during single leg squat and landing, whilst jump–landing training significantly influenced single leg landing and drop jump landing performance. The changes reported, therefore appear to be related to the nature of the training and the tasks undertaken during that training. The findings indicating that a combined training protocol incorporating both strengthening and jump–landing training may bring about the greatest improvement across a spectrum of tasks for the patient, supporting the previous work on multimodal training.

"A Proposed Model for Examining the Interference Phenomenon between Concurrent Aerobic and Strength Training.","Docherty, D.; Sporer, B.","Sports Medicine",="01121642",,="20001201","30","6","385","10","9593715",,,"Article","AEROBIC exercises; MUSCLES; HYPERTROPHY",,"A review of the current research on the interference phenomenon between concurrent aerobic and strength training indicates modest support for the model proposed in this article. However, it is clear that without a systematic approach to the investigation of the phenomenon there is lack of control and manipulation of the independent variables, which makes it difficult to test the validity of the model. To enhance the understanding of the interference phenomenon, it is important that researchers are precise and deliberate in their choice of training protocols. Clear definition of the specific training objectives for strength (muscle hypertrophy or neural adaptation) and aerobic power (maximal aerobic power or anaerobic threshold) are required. In addition, researchers should equate training volumes as much as possible for all groups. Care needs to be exercised to avoid overtraining individuals. There should be adequate recovery and regeneration between the concurrent training sessions as well as during the training cycle. The model should be initially tested by maintaining the same protocols throughout the duration of the study. However, it is becoming common practice to use a periodised approach in a training mesocycle in which there is a shift from high volume and moderate intensity training to lower volume and higher intensity. The model should be evaluated in the context of a periodised mesocycle provided the investigators are sensitive to the potential impact of the loading parameters on the interference phenomenon. It may be that the periodised approach is one way of maintaining the training stimulus and minimising the amount of interference. The effects of gender, training status, duration and frequency of training, and the mode of training need to be regarded as potential factors effecting the training response when investigating the interference phenomenon. Other experimental design factors such as unilateral limb training or training the upper body for one attribute and the lower body for another attribute, may help establish the validity of the model.

Due to more effective training and tremendous improvements in equipment and track preparation, the speed of Olympic XC-ski races has increased more than that of any other Olympic endurance sport. Moreover, pursuit, mass-start, and sprint races have been introduced. Indeed, 10 of the 12 current Olympic competitions in XC skiing involve mass starts, in which tactics play a major role and the outcome is often decided in the final sprint. Accordingly, reappraisal of the success factors for performance in this context is required. The very high aerobic capacity (VO2max) of many of today's world-class skiers is similar that of their predecessors. At the same time, the new events provide more opportunities to profit from anaerobic capacity, upper-body power, high-speed techniques, and ""tactical flexibility."" The wide range of speeds and slopes involved in XC skiing requires skiers to continuously alternate between and adapt different subtechniques during a race. This technical complexity places a premium on efficiency. The relative amounts of endurance training performed at different levels of intensity have remained essentially constant during the past 4 decades. However, in preparation for the Sochi Olympics in 2014, XC skiers are performing more endurance training on roller skis on competition-specific terrain, placing greater focus on upper-body power and more systematically performing strength training and skiing at high speeds than previously.

Possible reasons for compromises in strength-power adaptations with concurrent training are an increased likelihood of overtraining; differences in the organization of neuromuscular recruitment patterns; alterations in the concentrations of various hormones and differences in activation or repression of various anabolic/catabolic processes at the muscular level; and shifts in protein isozymes such as myosin. Recent research suggests that strength training may enhance endurance performance, although there are reasons to believe that resistance training can also be detrimental. Further research is necessary to determine the extent to which strength adaptations are compromised with concurrent training, and the mechanism(s) by which combined training negatively affects strength. It is recommended that the training of athletes takes into account the physiological demands of the sport and unique needs of the individual athlete in designing a training program in order to optimize performance.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH280628&site=ehost-live"

Materials and Methods: Twenty oen-athlete men with type-2 diabetes were randomly divided into control and training groups. Combined training was performed for six weeks. Training including 25-35 minutes of aerobic exercise with an intensity of 55-75% of maximum heart rate and five resistance movements involving large muscles in the upper and lower body Includes five movements: chest press, army press, squat, dead lift, dumbbell rowing with an intensity of 55-75% of a maximum repetition with a frequency of three times a week with the periorizing of resistance training on aerobic training. The intensity of aerobic exercise was measured with heart rate monitor and the intensity of resistance training was measured every two weeks with a maximum repetition test. For data analysis, dependent and independent t-test was used at the significant level of P ≤ 0.05. Results: Examining the results of the study, it was found that the training contract reduced the SAA index (16.7%) and significantly changed it in the training group compared to the control group (P = 0.047. However, there was no effect on resting SAA in the control group and a 2.2% increase in PTX3 in the training group was not significant (P = 0.474). Conclusion: According to the results of the study and a significant decrease in inflammatory factor SAA and increase in PTX3, it can be concluded that six weeks of combined training affects the levels of these factors in men with type-2 diabetes and can probably reduce inflammation in these patients.

However, whether similar responses are observed with resistance exercise ( RE) remains obscure. Thus, this study analysed the relationship between the acute BP responses to a single bout of RE and chronic changes in resting BP after a RE training in medicated hypertensive elderly women. Methods and results Twenty medicated hypertensive women participated in the study. They underwent an acute RE bout where BP and heart rate ( HR) were obtained at rest and for 60 min after the RE. Subsequently, the participants underwent a progressive RE training for 12 weeks at 60-80% of maximal strength test. Resting BP and HR were also obtained after the RE training. The chronic decreases in systolic and diastolic BP were significantly greater in the participants who experienced acutely decreased systolic and diastolic BP, respectively ( P<0·05). The changes in systolic BP after acute RE were correlated with the chronic changes in resting systolic BP after RE training ( r = 0·47; P = 0·03). Similar correlations between acute and chronic responses were also observed for diastolic BP ( r = 0·70; P = 0·01), mean BP ( r = 0·58; P = 0·01), HR ( r = 0·73; P<0·01) and RPP ( r = 0·52; P = 0·01). Conclusion Similar to previously work involving aerobic exercise, BP responses to a single bout of RE are strongly related to chronic effects of RE training on BP in medicated hypertensive elderly women.

Acute capsaicin supplementation improved resistance exercise performance performed after a high-intensity intermittent running in resistance-trained men. J Strength Cond Res 36(1): 130–134, 2022—We sought to investigate the acute effects of capsaicin supplementation on the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and heart rate during high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and resistance exercise performance executed after HIIE in resistance-trained men. Eleven resistance-trained men completed 2 randomized, double-blind trials: capsaicin condition or a placebo condition. The concurrent exercise session was composed of a 5-km intermittent run (1:1 effort and passive recovery ratio) and subsequent resistance exercise (4 × 70% of 1RM until muscle failure in the half-squat exercise). Heart rate was recorded during HIIE and after the protocol RPE (0–10 scale) was accessed. The resistance exercise performance was analyzed by the maximum number of repetitions performed for each set and the total volume (repetitions × weight lifted). During HIIE, the RPE (capsaicin = 7 ± 1 vs. placebo = 8 ± 1 points, t = −3.674, p = 0.005) and mean heart rate (capsaicin = 153 ± 13 vs. placebo = 158 ± 12 bpm, t = −2.292, p = 0.048) were significantly lower in the capsaicin compared with placebo condition. For subsequent resistance exercise, there was a significant decrease in volume across time (F = 19.889, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.69) with maximal number of repetitions performed in capsaicin than placebo condition (2,077.6 ± 465.2 kg vs. 1,838.9 ± 624.1 kg, p = 0.028, d = 0.43), but the condition vs. set was not significant (F = 0.582, p = 0.632, η2 = 0.06). Acute capsaicin supplementation induced a lower mean heart rate and RPE during HIIE and improved subsequent resistance exercise performance in resistance-trained men.

Eight physically active men (age: 26.9 ± 4.2 years; body mass: 82.1 ± 7.5 kg; height: 178.9 ± 6.0 cm) were submitted to: (a) a graded exercise test to determine O2max (39.26 ± 6.95 ml·kg<1·min<1) and anaerobic threshold velocity (3.5 mmol·L-1) (9.3 ± 1.27 km·h-1); (b) strength tests in a rested state (control); and (c) 4 experimental sessions, at least 7 days apart. The experimental sessions consisted of a 5-kilometer run on a treadmill continuously (90% of the anaerobic threshold velocity) or intermittently (1:1 minute at O2max). Ten minutes after the aerobic exercise, either a maximum strength or a strength endurance test was performed (leg press and bench press exercises). The order of aerobic and strength exercises followed a William's square distribution to avoid carryover effects. Results showed that only the intermittent aerobic exercise produced an acute interference effect on leg strength endurance, decreasing significantly (p < 0.05) the number of repetitions from 10.8 ± 2.5 to 8.1 ± 2.2. Maximum strength was not affected by the aerobic exercise mode. In conclusion, the acute interference hypothesis in concurrent training seems to occur when both aerobic and strength exercises produce significant peripheral fatigue in the same muscle group.

A major challenge with concurrent training is how to adequately combine and sequence strength exercise and aerobic exercise to avoid interference effects. This is particularly relevant for athletes. Objective: We aimed to examine the acute effects of aerobic exercise on subsequent measures of muscle strength and power in trained male individuals. Design: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis. Data Sources: Systematic literature searches in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were conducted up to July 2021. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies: Studies were included that applied a within-group repeated-measures design and examined the acute effects of aerobic exercise (i.e., running, cycling exercise) on subsequent measures of lower limb muscle strength (e.g., maximal isometric force of the knee extensors) and/or proxies of lower limb muscle power (e.g., countermovement jump height) in trained individuals. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Aerobic exercise resulted in moderate declines in muscle strength (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.79; p = 0.003). Low-intensity aerobic exercise did not moderate effects on muscle strength (SMD = 0.65; p = 0.157) while moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise resulted in moderate declines in muscle strength (SMD = 0.65; p = 0.020). However, the difference between subgroups was not statistically significant (p = 0.979). Regarding aerobic exercise duration, large declines in muscle strength were found after > 30 min (SMD = 1.02; p = 0.049) while ≤ 30 min of aerobic exercise induced moderate declines in muscle strength (SMD = 0.59; p = 0.013). The subgroup difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.204). Cycling exercise resulted in significantly larger decrements in muscle strength (SMD = 0.79; p = 0.002) compared with running (SMD = 0.28; p = 0.035). The difference between subgroups was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). For muscle power, aerobic exercise did not result in any statistically significant changes (SMD = 0.04; p = 0.846). Conclusions: Aerobic exercise induced moderate declines in measures of muscle strength with no statistically significant effects on proxies of muscle power in trained male individuals. It appears that higher compared with lower intensity as well as longer compared with shorter aerobic exercise duration exacerbate acute declines in muscle strength. Our results provide evidence for acute interference effects when aerobic exercies is performed before strength exercises. These findings may help practitioners to better prescribe single training sessions, particularly if environmental and/or infrastructural reasons (e.g., availability of training facilities) do not allow the application of strength training before aerobic exercise.

Methods: Fifteen physically active men completed 2 sessions consisting of HIIT (4 × 4 min cycling at 80% of peak power output) immediately followed by lower- (HIIT + LBS) or upper-body (HIIT + UBS) strength loading (3 × 5 + 3 × 3 repetitions at 80% 1-repetition maximum [ie, 6 sets in total]) in a randomized order. Squat and bench-press mean propulsive velocity (MPV) was assessed before HIIT (T0), immediately after HIIT (T1), immediately after the strength loading (T2), and 24 hours after the experimental session (T3). Results: Squat MPV decreased to a similar magnitude at T1 in HIIT + LBS (−5.3% [7.6%], P =.117, g =.597) and HIIT + UBS (−5.7% [6.9%], P =.016, g =.484), while bench press remained unchanged (−1.4% [4.7%], P = 1.000, g =.152, and −1.0% [7.0%], P = 1.000, g =.113, respectively). Both squat and bench-press MPV were statistically reduced at T2 compared to T0 (HIIT + LBS: −7.5% [7.8%], P =.016, g =.847, and −6.8% [4.6%], P <.001, g =.724; HIIT + UBS: −3.9% [3.8%], P =.007, g =.359, and −15.5% [6.7%], P <.001, d = 1.879). Bench-press MPV at T2 was significantly lower in HIIT + UBS when compared to HIIT + LBS (P =.002, d = 1.219). Conclusion: These findings indicate lower- but not upper-body explosive strength to be acutely reduced by preceding lower-body HIIT. However, lower-body HIIT combined with either upper- or lower-body strength loading resulted in a similar acute reduction of both squat and bench-press explosive strength.

Fourteen highly trained male handball players (age: 25.4 (26.2 ± 4.2) performed HIIT consisting of repeated 15-second shuttle runs at 90% of final running speed (VIFT) to exhaustion. Upper-body and lower-body explosive strength and throwing velocities were measured before and immediately after HIIT, as well as after 6 hours. These tests included 3 repetitions of both bench press and squat exercise at 60% of the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) as well as 3 repetitions of the set shot without run up and jump shot, respectively. Explosive squat performance was significantly reduced at post (−5.48%, p = 0.026) but not at 6 h (−0.24%, p = 1.000). Explosive bench press performance remained statistically unaltered at post (0.32%, p = 1.000) and at 6 hour (1.96%, p = 1.000). This was also observed in the subsequent throws both immediately after (−0.60%, p = 1.000) (−0.31%, p = 1.000) and at 6 h (−1.58%, p = 1.000) (1.51%, p = 0.647). Our data show a reduction in explosive strength of the lower but not upper extremities when preceded by running HIIT. Since throwing velocity was not affected by intense lower-body exercise, combining lower-body HIIT and throwing practice may be of no concern in highly trained handball players.

More recently, we have demonstrated that an individual day-to-day variations of arterial stiffness is associated with maximal aerobic performance. PURPOSE: Under these research backgrounds, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that one-bout static stretching exercise-induced decrease in arterial stiffness improves maximal aerobic performance. METHODS: Twelve healthy young men (age 22±2 years, mean±standard deviation) who were not actively involved in regular resistance or endurance training participated in the present study. Each participant performed a single bout of whole body static stretching exercise protocol involving the trunk, upper limb, and lower limb (stretch), and sedentary control (control: seated rest in the exercise room) trials on separate days in a randomized controlled crossover fashion. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) as an index of systemic arterial stiffness, brachial blood pressure and heart rate were measured before, immediately after and at 30 min after both trials. After these measurements, maximal oxygen uptake (...O2max) was assessed using a graded power test on an electronically braked cycle ergometer. RESULTS: Neither blood pressure nor heart rate differed significantly between the trials or from the baseline at any time point after both trials. Baseline baPWV did not significantly differ between both trials. baPWV was significantly decreased at 30 min after the stretch trial (1057±32 cm/sec, P=0.01) from the baseline (1128±36 cm/sec), while it did not significantly change immediately after the stretch trial (1117±32 cm/sec). In contrast, baPWV did not significantly change from the baseline at any time point after the control trial (baseline, 1135±61 cm/sec; immediately after, 1145±49 cm/sec; 30 min after, 1144±42 cm/sec). In addition, ...O2max in the stretch trial was significantly higher (49.1±1.8 mL/kg/min, P=0.03) than in the control trial (47.2±2.5 mL/kg/min). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that acute decrease in arterial stiffness by one-bout static stretching exercise may improve maximal aerobic performance.

Six fitness enthusiasts, previously trained in weightlifting (WL) and cardiovascular conditioning, performed a weightlifting session consisting of three Universal equipment leg exercises (leg press, leg extension, leg curl). Immediately afterward, the subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer at 65 percent of their VO2max for 30 minutes. Physiological parameters of heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (V02), ventilation (Ve), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during submaximal trials and compared to controls who performed cycle ergometry without a previous strength training session. An unpaired t-Test was employed to evaluate the influence of strength training on the various physiological parameters during submaximal aerobic exercise. Only heart rate changed significantly (p less than .05) due to the intervention, whereas V02, Ve, RER, and RPE were unaffected by the strength training session. The mean difference between submaximal exercise trials for heart rate within the control group was -1.0 beats per minute, whereas the experimental group showed an increase of 8.83 bpm between trials (p is .0475). Therefore, if fitness enthusiasts are judging exercise intensity by HR alone, they will achieve a lesser training stimulus during the aerobic conditioning phase of cross-training. Those judging exercise intensity by a predetermined equipment setting will achieve a higher HR but probably not a greater training stimulus.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH411056&site=ehost-live"

In sessions 5-7, TRAD, ACWT, and CWIT were performed in a randomized order ⩾ 72 hr apart for measures of BLA, HR, and RPE at preexercise and following each of three mini-circuit weight training stations. Repeated-measures ANOVAs yielded significant interactions (p < 0.05) in BLA, HR, and RPE. Combined circuit weight-interval training (CWIT) produced higher BLA (7.31 ± 0.37 vs. TRAD: 3.99 ± 0.26, ACWT: 4.54 ± 0.31 mmol.L<Sup>-1</Sup>), HR (83.51 ± 1.18 vs. TRAD: 70.42 ± 1.67, ACWT: 74.13 ± 1.43 beats.min<Sup>-1</Sup>) and RPE (8.14 ± 0.41 vs. TRAD: 5.06 ± 0.43, ACWT: 6.15 ± 0.42) at all measures. Aerobic circuit weight training (ACWT) elicited greater RPE than traditional circuit weight training (TRAD) at all measures. Including combined circuit weight-interval training (CWIT) workouts into exercise programming may enhance fitness benefits and maximize timeefficiency more so than traditional circuit training methods.

Methods: Nine active women (24 [3] y; 60 [5] kg) completed 4 sessions: (1) familiarization, (2) aquatic maximal test to determine the heart rate corresponding to the anaerobic threshold, (3) CT protocol with aerobic–resistance sequence, and (4) CT protocol with resistance–aerobic sequence. Both protocols started and ended with the participants in the supine position for 30 minutes to perform resting and postexercise oxygen consumption measurements. The water-based resistance protocol comprised 4 sets of 15 seconds at maximal velocity, and the water-based aerobic protocol was performed at a continuous intensity (heart rate corresponding to the anaerobic threshold). EE measurements were calculated based on oxygen consumption and the corresponding caloric equivalent. Paired t test was used to compare the EE values between the water-based CT intrasession exercise sequences (α =.05). Results: There was no difference between the water-based aerobic–resistance and resistance–aerobic in total EE (330.78 vs 329.56 kcal; P =.96), EE per minute (7.35 vs 7.32 kcal·min−1; P =.96), and postexercise EE (63.65 vs 59.92 kcal; P =.50). Conclusions: The intrasession exercise sequence during water-based CT had no influence on the EE in young women.

Methods: Nine strength-trained students (age 24.1 ± 4.1) performed two different concurrent exercise orders: strength–sprint (STS) and sprint–strength (SPS). Strength training consisted of three sets of ten repetitions with 10RM for four exercises: bench press, lat pulldown, squat and shoulder press. Sprint exercise consisted of eight repetitions of 30-m maximal sprint running with 45-s rest periods between repetitions. In both exercise orders, the subjects rested for 10 min after the completion of the first part of the concurrent training session. Blood samples were collected before, between exercise modalities, and immediately after the concurrent training sessions. Results: A significant increase in growth hormone levels occurred in response to single sessions of concurrent strength–sprint training, but no significant difference was observed between the two different orders of concurrent training (STS vs. SPS) regarding the acute growth hormone response. Conclusions: In general, performing sprint training before or after strength training not only imposes no inhibitory effect on the growth hormone response to strength training, but also increases the hormone's overall response.

The combination between aerobic and strength performance suggest evidences that endurance training, if applied before resistive training (RE), may influence the performance of the last one. So, this study intends to verify the acute influence of a 40 minutes mini- trampoline class over the number of repetitions in an RE. The sample we have used included 12 women, who practice both activities (RE and mini- trampoline) at least six months. The study has included four visits, with a 48-hour interval between them. In the first visit we have evaluated the maximum weight in 10 maximum repetitions (10RM). In the second day the 10RM re-test was made. In the third day, the individuals were submitted to mini- trampoline session and then the squat was made with loads determined in 10RM. In the fourth day, the volunteers get only the squat with loads obtained in 10RM. In order to verify the behavior of the number of repetitions, we have used a two-entry factorial ANOVA, followed by the post-hoc Tuckey (p<0.05) test. When we compared the number of RE repetitions, without previous mini- trampoline class and after mini- trampoline, all the sets compared have shown a reduction in the number of repetitions. We have verified that the mini- trampoline class has a negative influence in RE performance in trained women.

Methods : Ten male, recreational team sport athletes with a history of RT participated in a randomized crossover study involving an intermittent sprint protocol (ISP), lower limb RT, and CT (ISP and RT separated by 1 h). Before (PRE), immediately after (POST), 24 h and 48 h after each exercise condition, quadriceps muscle activation, voluntary activation, muscle contractile function (evoked twitch responses), creatine kinase, muscle soreness, and Profile of Mood States (POMS)-fatigue were recorded. Results : Quadriceps contractile function was hampered in all conditions, with a significantly greater decline observed POST RT (58.4% +/- 18.0%) and CT (54.8% +/- 8.6%) compared with ISP (35.9% +/- 10.7%, P < 0.05), recovering at 48 h after all exercise conditions. POMS-fatigue ratings increased at POST in all conditions with CT and ISP eliciting the greatest increase, returning to baseline 48 h after all exercise conditions. Quadriceps muscle soreness remained elevated from PRE at 48 h after all exercise conditions. No changes across time were observed for voluntary activation and quadriceps surface EMG amplitude after any exercise condition. The volume and load lifted in the RT session was unaffected by previous intermittent exercise (ISP) in CT. Conclusions : RT impairs contractile function, which is not exacerbated when performed 1 h after the ISP. Contractile function after all exercise conditions displayed the same recovery profile (48 h) despite the postexercise decrement being smaller after the ISP compared with RT and CT. Previous intermittent sprint exercise does not negatively affect the volume of exercise performed in a lower limb RT session.

Methods: Twelve male swimmers (age: 19.0 [2.2] y, peak oxygen uptake: 65.5 [11.4] mL·kg-1·min-1) performed a 5 x 200-m test with progressively increasing intensity. Blood lactate (BL) concentration was measured after each 200-m bout, and the speed corresponding to 4 mmol·L-1 (V4) was calculated. In the experimental (EXP) and control (CON) conditions, swimmers participated in a swim training session consisting of 1000-m warm-up, a bout of 10-second tethered swimming sprint, and 5 x 400 m at V4. In EXP condition, swimmers completed a dry-land strength training session (load: 85% of 1-repetition maximum) 15 minutes before the swimming session. In CON condition, swimmers performed the swimming session only. Oxygen uptake, BL concentration, arm-stroke rate, arm-stroke length, and arm-stroke efficiency were measured during the 5 x 400 m. Results: Force in the 10-second sprint was not different between conditions (P = .61), but fatigue index was higher in the EXP condition (P = .03). BL concentration was higher in EXP condition and showed large effect size at the fifth 400-m repetition compared with CON condition (6.4 [2.7] vs 4.6 [2.8] mmol·L-1, d = 0.63). During the 5 x 400 m, arm-stroke efficiency remained unchanged, arm-stroke length was decreased from the third repetition onward (P = .01), and arm-stroke rate showed a medium increment in EXP condition (d = 0.23). Conclusions: Strength training completed 15 minutes before a swim training session caused moderate changes in biomechanical parameters and increased BL concentration during swimming. Despite these changes, swimmers were able to maintain force and submaximal speed during the endurance training session.

A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and SciELO. The search was limited to studies published from 1980 to 2012. A total of 3,390 articles were retrieved. After reading their titles, 127 studies were further evaluated by reading their abstracts. This resulted in 92 papers that were read in full; 25 of these were selected and their results were described in the present review. Several studies showed that, in elderly subjects, ST can produce increases in muscle strength, power, activation and mass. ST-induced strength gain may be explained by neural and morphological adaptations. The main neural adaptations to ST included increased recruitment of motor units and increased motor unit firing rate. Morphological adaptations included increases in the physiological cross-sectional area (CSA) of the muscle, in muscle thickness, in muscle fiber pennation angle, and changes in muscle myosin heavy-chain isoforms, resulting in the conversion of muscle fiber from subtype IIx to IIa. The inclusion of moderate-to-high intensity (60-85% of maximum strength) ST in the routine of this population is recommended to improve neuromuscular function. CT can promote significant neuromuscular adaptations, but these gains may be of a lower magnitude than those obtained with ST. Although CT has an interference effect on neuromuscular adaptations, it also promotes improvement in cardiovascular function and is therefore the most frequently recommended intervention for health promotion in the elderly.

LV dimensions were measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography and the results were equal irrespective of method. Endurance-trained m and f had significantly higher LV volumes and mass than both strength-trained and controls. No VO2 max or dimensional differences were seen between strength-trained and untrained subjects. In endurance-trained males, LV volumes and mass/kg bw were higher than in endurance-trained females. There was no significant gender difference for strength-trained or untrained subjects regarding body weight-related heart dimensions. It is concluded that LV dimensions and volumes are strongly dependent on oxygen transport capacity in normal subjects practising different modes of training, and that the gender differences, if LV dimensions are related to aerobic work capacity, are smaller than previously reported.

The main mechanisms which account for adaptive responses will be specified. Current knowledge. - Skeletal muscle commonly increase their mass after heavy-resistance training. The increased muscle mass mainly results from myofiber hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia of muscle cells. The myosin heavy-chain (MHC) composition of skeletal muscles is affected by strength training; an increased percentage of MHC-IIa isoform, in parallel with a decrease in MHC-IIx (or MHC-IIb) isoform are commonly reported. Moreover, a decrease in oxidative capacity occurred in skeletal muscle, while the transcription rate of some genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, and responsive to oxygen-sensitive transcription factors, is enhanced with strength training. An increased capillary network occurred in skeletal muscle during strength training; the general increase in capillaries is aimed to maintain a correct oxygen supply in the hypertrophied fibres. The mechanisms of the training-induced angiogenesis remain poorly understood, but the role played by the oxygen stimulus needs to be examined in further studies. Future prospects. - In contrast to endurance training, the mechanisms by which skeletal muscle responds to strength remain largely unknown. Further studies are needed to examine the molecular mechanisms of MHC isoform transitions and angiogenesis.

Twelve professional rugby league players who regularly performed combined maximal strength and power training were observed across a 4-year period with test data reported every 2 years (years 1998, 2000, and 2002). Upper-body strength was assessed by the 1 repetition maximum bench press and maximum power during bench press throws (BT Pmax) with various barbell resistances of 40-80 kg. During the initial testing, players also were identified as elite (n = 6) or subelite (n = 6), depending upon whether they participated in the elite first-division national league or second-division league. This subgrouping allowed for a comparison of the scope of changes dependent upon initial strength and training experience. The subelite group was significantly younger, less strong, and less powerful than the elite group, but no other difference existed in height or body mass in 1998. Across the 4-year period, significant increases in strength occurred for the group as a whole and larger increases were observed for the subelite than the elite group, verifying the limited scope that exists for strength gain in more experienced, elite resistance-trained athletes. A similar trend occurred for changes in BT Pmax. This long-term observation confirms that the rate of progress in strength and power development diminishes with increased strength levels and resistance training experience. Furthermore, it also indicates that strength and power can still be increased despite a high volume of concurrent resistance and endurance training.

Studies prove the negative interference of the aerobic training on the strength training, mainly when we center in the adaptations that occur in the skeletal muscle. The work studied the possible interferences that the crossed strength and aerobic training can provoke in the ergometric variables. Materials and Methods: 33 young subjects from the male sex, were divided into three groups: Control Group (GC; n=11); Aerobic-Strength Group (GAF; n=11); and Strength-Aerobic Group (GFA; n=11). The training was developed during 12 weeks, being six weeks of aerobic training and six weeks of strength training. In the end of each six weeks the groups GAF and GFA changed training between themselves. We identified the VO2peak through a progressive test in cycle ergometer and we find the mechanical power and the ergometric index (IErg) in the same instrument. Results: We identified an increase in the VO2peak, mechanical power and IErg after the aerobic training, and a not significant increase in the strength training group. After the change of training we did not find significant increases in none of the variables. Discussion: The aerobic training caused an increase in the studied variables, while the strength training performed after the aerobic helped in the maintenance of the gains achieved.

Maximal strength (1RM), body composition and power were assessed pre- and post-intervention.Results: Leg press 1RM increased ~ 24 ± 13% and ~ 33 ± 16% in CET and RES from PRE-to-POST (P < 0.001), with no difference between groups. Total lean mass increased ~ 4% in both CET and RES from PRE-to-POST (P < 0.001). Ultrasound estimated vastus lateralis volume increased ~ 15% in CET and ~ 11% in RES from PRE-to-POST (P < 0.001), with no difference between groups. Wingate peak power relative to body mass displayed a trend (P = 0.053) to be greater in RES (12.5 ± 1.6 W·kg BM−1) than both CET (10.8 ± 1.7 W·kg BM−1) and END (10.9 ± 1.8 W·kg BM−1) at POST. Absolute VO2peak increased 6.9% in CET and 12% in END from PRE-to-POST (P < 0.05), with no difference between groups.Conclusion: Despite high protein availability, select measures of anaerobic power-based adaptations, but not muscle strength or hypertrophy, appear susceptible to ‘interference effects’ with CET and should be closely monitored throughout training macro-cycles.Trials Registry: This trial was registered with the Australian-New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12617001229369).

The purpose of the present study was to examine if this mode of concurrent training translates into increased mitochondrial content and improved endurance performance. Moderately trained cyclists performed 8 weeks (two sessions per week) of endurance training only ( E, n = 10; 60-min cycling) or endurance training followed by strength training ( ES, n = 9; 60-min cycling + leg press). Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after the training period and analyzed for enzyme activities and protein content. Only the ES group increased in leg strength (+19%, P < 0.01), sprint peak power (+5%, P < 0.05), and short-term endurance (+9%, P < 0.01). In contrast, only the E group increased in muscle citrate synthase activity (+11%, P = 0.06), lactate threshold intensity (+3%, P < 0.05), and long-term endurance performance (+4%, P < 0.05). Content of mitochondrial proteins and cycling economy was not affected by training. Contrary to our hypothesis, the results demonstrate that concurrent training does not enhance muscle aerobic capacity and endurance performance in cyclists.

However, there is emerging evidence for cross over between modalities where aerobic training stimulates traditional adaptations to resistance training (e.g., hypertrophy) and resistance training stimulates traditional adaptations to aerobic training (e.g., mitochondrial biogenesis). The latter is the focus of the current review in which we propose high-volume resistance training (i.e., high time under tension) leads to aerobic adaptations such as angiogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased oxidative capacity. As time under tension increases, skeletal muscle energy turnover, metabolic stress, and ischemia also increase, which act as signals to activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, which is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. For practical application, the acute stress and chronic adaptations to three specific forms of high-time under tension are also discussed: Slow-tempo, low-intensity resistance training, and drop-set resistance training. These modalities of high-time under tension lead to hallmark adaptations to resistance training such as muscle endurance, hypertrophy, and strength, but little is known about their effect on traditional aerobic training adaptations.

Methods: We examined AER, RES, and AER + RES training (9 months) commensurate with physical activity guidelines in individuals with T2D (n = 262; 63% female, 44% black). Primary outcomes were change in, and prevalence of, metabolic syndrome score at follow-up (mean and 95% confidence interval [CI]). Secondary outcomes included maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) and estimated METs from time-to-exhaustion (TTE) and exercise efficiency calculated as the slope of the line between ventilatory threshold, respiratory compensation, and maximal fitness. General linear models and bootstrapped Spearman correlations were used to examine changes in metabolic syndrome associated with training primary and secondary outcome variables. Results: We observed a significant decrease in metabolic syndrome scores (P for trend = 0.003) for AER (-0.59, 95% CI = -1.00 to -0.21 ) and AER + RES (-0.79, 95% CI = -1.40 to -0.35), both being significant (P < 0.02) versus control (0.26, 95% CI = -0.58 to 0.40) and RES (-0.13, 95% CI = - 1.00 to 0.24). This led to a reduction in metabolic syndrome prevalence for the AER (56% vs 43%) and AER + RES (55% vs 46%) groups between baseline and follow-up. The observed decrease in metabolic syndrome was mediated by significant improvements in exercise efficiency for the AER and AER + RES training groups (P < 0.05), which was more strongly related to TTE (25%-30%; r= -0.38, 95% CI = -0.55 to -0.19) than VO2peak (5%-6%; r = -0.24, 95% CI = -0.45 to -0.01). Conclusions: AER and AER + RES training significantly improved metabolic syndrome scores and prevalence in patients with T2D. These improvements appear to be associated with improved exercise efficiency and are more strongly related to improved TTE versus VO2peak.

Results: Maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) and left ventricular wall thickness were greater in the triathletes compared to the sedentary peers. The absolute value of ṾO2max (i.e., mL/min) and left ventricular wall thickness were higher in the Olympian than in the student triathletes, but ṾO2max per body weight (i.e., mL/kg/min) was comparable between the two groups. Lean body weight was greater in the Olympian compared to the sedentary students, whereas there was no significant difference between the student triathletes and the sedentary counterparts. Lean body weight was correlated with the absolute value of ṾO2max. Conclusions: The present results suggest that the Olympic triathlete had higher muscle mass-derived greater absolute aerobic capacity and athlete heart phenotype that is seen in muscular strength-trained athletes. Increasing absolute aerobic capacity by strength training may be useful for improving the competitiveness in young triathletes.

We determined the absolute and relative EE during the performance of two weight training programs of different intensities, durations and total work in males and females. Eight male and seven female recreational weight trainers (20-29 y) completed two randomly ordered weight training sessions involving 2 sets of 8 standard upper and lower body lifts at a set cadence separated by 45 seconds rest between sets and lifts (48 hrs apart). Heavy (H) at 100 % 8 Repetition Maximum (8RM), 8 reps, approximately 19 min duration and light (L) at 85 % 8RM, 15 reps, approximately 23 min duration. VO2 was determined continuously throughout the training sessions. Lean body mass (LBM) was estimated from skin fold measures and body weight. Energy expenditure was estimated from breath-by-breath metabolic measurements using portable metabolic assessment equipment (Cosmed K4b2). Absolute EE (total kJ) and rate of energy expenditure per minute (kJ per min) were not significantly different between H and L intensities and male and female subjects. The rate of EE averaged between approximately 10-12 kJ per min. However, relative EE (J per kg LBM per min per unit work) were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.02) for females compared to males in both H: (26.46 +/- 8.06 females vs 14.36 +/- 3.02 males) and L: (19.91 +/- 4.28 females vs. 9.83 +/- 3.28 males), intensities.

An optimal weight loss programme for both populations should selectively deplete body fat while maintaining lean tissue. Another concern, particularly for athletes but also for obese persons participating in an exercise programme, is maintenance of physical performance. Treatments relying only on energy restriction commonly cause substantial loss of lean tissue, but the addition of aerobic exercise has frequently been shown to reduce this loss. Although less commonly used, resistance exercise appears to prevent loss of or even increase muscle mass during energy restriction. This type of exercise is less likely than aerobic exercise to acutely increase energy and lipid utilisation but may increase lean tissue, metabolic rate and thus indirectly aid weight reduction.. Impairment of aerobic capacity, aerobic endurance, and muscle dysfunction has been demonstrated during energy restriction in athletes and obese persons. Incorporation of exercise into the weight loss programme may alleviate some of these negative consequences on performance. The addition of aerobic exercise of adequate intensity and duration has been shown to improve aerobic performance, even during severe energy restriction in obese individuals. Although resistance exercise will not cause an improvement of aerobic performance, increase in muscle size and strength have been noted concurrent with substantial weight loss. In summary, the value of aerobic exercise during weight loss is clear but the place of resistance exercise is intriguing but unresolved. To make development of ideal treatments for weight loss even more complex, the quantity of protein and carbohydrate in the energy-restricted diets may interact with the exercise prescription to determine the influence of the programme on body composition and physical performance in athletes and obese individuals.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH271897&site=ehost-live"

However, previous studies have not explored any submaximal cardiorespiratory adaptations that may result from this training protocol. The aim of the current investigation was to evaluate the effect of supplementing an aerobic exercise training program with a muscular endurance training program on various cardiorespiratory and metabolic measurements. Fourteen aerobically active men performed an incremental exercise test to determine the OBLA, gas exchange threshold (GET), and maximal oxygen uptake (...O2max). Maximal strength was measured using 1 repetition maximum (1RM) for leg press (LP), leg curl (LC), and leg extension (LE). Eight subjects supplemented their aerobic activity (experimental [EX] group) with 8 weeks of muscular endurance training, while 6 continued their regular aerobic activity (control [CON] group). No significant group differences were observed for all pretraining variables. After 8 weeks of training, no significant differences in body mass, GET, and ...O2max were observed for either group. However, the EX group showed a significant improvement for both absolute and relative ...O2 at OBLA compared with the CON group. Leg curl and LE 1RM assessments for the EX group showed a significant improvement compared with CON group. Muscular endurance training did not improve GET and ...O2max, but significantly increased ...O2 at OBLA, LP, and LC. These find- ings suggest that this training protocol maybe useful in the development of submaximal aerobic performance and leg strength for endurance athletes.

Estimated VO2max increased for the AT (32.1±1.1 to 38.4±1.0 ml·kg−1·min−1). A smaller increase for the WT (30.5±1.1 to 33.8±1.0) was likely due to increased leg strength, and VO2max did not change for the NT (32.5±1.1 to 32.9±1.0). Heart rate and RPP levels were lower during psychological stress and recovery after training for AT relative to the WT and NT. Overall SBP was also lower in the AT relative to the NT but not the WT. In conclusion, aerobic training lowered cardiovascular activity levels during psychological stress and recovery in healthy young adults, implying a protective role against age-related increases in coronary heart disease for individuals who adopt aerobic exercise early in life and maintain the behavior across the life span.

Methods: Elderly men and women (age 63.2 ± 4.7) were randomized into two intervention groups: an aerobic group (AG,n = 17) and a combined group (CG,n = 16). Subjects trained 40 minutes three times a week for 12 weeks. Both groups trained 20 minutes at 65% of heart rate reserve on ergometer cycles followed by another 20 minutes on the ergometer cycles for AG and 20-minute strength training for the lower body for CG. The primary outcome was VO2max. Secondary outcomes were maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in isometric knee extension, 1 repetition maximum in three leg exercises, body fat, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure and score on the Health Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36). Results: Both groups improved VO2max (p < .01) and MVC (p < .001). VO2max increased 17% confidence interval (CI) [7.4–26] in CG and 26% CI [14.1–38.2] in AG, with no significant difference between groups. MVC increased 22% CI [16.3–27.7] in CG and 9% CI [4.6–13.5] in AG with CG improving MVC more than AG (p < .01). CG's score on the general health dimension on the SF-36 health survey improved more than AG's score. Conclusion: Elderly can substitute a part of their aerobic training with strength training and still improve VO2max to a clinically significant degree when strength training is performed with large muscle groups subsequently to the aerobic training. Combined training additionally improves strength and self-assessed general health more than aerobic training alone.

A strategy for prevention and management of obesity is aerobic training (AT) due to its effectiveness to decrease fat mass. AT increases the content of SIRT3, a mitochondrial protein that increases the expression of PGC-1α and NFR1, thereby enhances mitochondrial function and metabolic health. Resistance training (RT) provides metabolic benefits but its effect on SIRT3 content is unknown. To compare the effect of AT and RT on SIRT3, PGC-1α and NRF-1 protein levels in skeletal muscle of sedentary obese adolescents. Twenty-seven sedentary obese male adolescents (age: 16.7 ± 0.9 years; BMI: 33.7 ± 4.3 kg/m²) completed a 1-month control period prior to randomization to one of two supervised exercise protocols: AT (3 days/week, 40 min/day, 70-80% peak heart rate) or RT (3 days/week, 11 exercises, 2 sets/exercise, 12 repetitions/set) for 12 weeks. Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after 12 weeks to analyse SIRT3, PGC-1α and NRF-1 proteins content. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and anthropometric variables were evaluated before and after training. AT increased SIRT3 content, which was associated with improvements in PGC-1α content and body fat percentage. RT did not affect SIRT3 or PGC-1α. VO2peak increased only in AT. The increase in muscle mitochondrial SIRT3 was observed only following AT. In contrast, RT increased muscle mass without improving SIRT3 in obese male adolescents.

We considered that the comparative study of the aerobic and anaerobic performance parameters of specifically trained athletes can offer practical information about these adaptation. For this purpose were analysed the results from 450 top athletes, trained in aerobic, anaerobic and mixed energogenesis sports activities, obtained during the assessment of the effort capacity. The results sustain that training a particular energetic pathway at high level can have negative or positive effects on the other one, based on the athlete's gender. The excessive training of the aerobic effort capacity happen to the detriment of the anaerobic effort capacity for both, female and male athletes. The very high intensity, short duration training which characterizes the physical training in the alactic anaerobic trials corroborated with decreasing the maximum oxygen consumption only in the male anaerobic alactic group, while the female anaerobic groups, both alactic and lactic, registered positive correlations with the maximum oxygen consumption.

Data related to primary outcomes (functional ability, respiratory function, fatigue, pain, quality of life, upper-body strength, lower-body strength and Vo 2 peak) and secondary outcomes (adverse events and feasibility of exercises) was extracted from all studies and systematically reviewed. 16 trials including 532 patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, eight studies were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found a statistically significant difference in favor of exercise in functional ability (P = 0.001), overall quality of life (P = 0.03) and Vo 2 peak (P = 0.01). The included trials were generally of poor quality and had a risk of bias. However, the results of sensitivity analysis, after omitting studies with high risk of bias, showed no statistically significant difference in functional ability (P = 0.05), overall quality of life (P = 0.12) and Vo2peak (P = 0.13). Finally, no significant difference was found in respiratory function, fatigue, pain, and upper-body and lower-body strength.

In this review, we aim to evaluate the effects of aerobic, resistance and combined aerobic and resistance training on arterial stiffness in individuals with and without hypertension. We systematically searched the Pubmed and Web of Science database from 1985 until December 2013 for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The data were extracted by one investigator and checked by a second investigator. The training effects on arterial stiffness were estimated using weighted mean differences of the relative changes (%) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We finally reviewed the results from 17 RCTs. The available evidence indicates that aerobic exercise tends to have a beneficial effect on arterial stiffness in normotensive and hypertensive patients, but does not affect arterial stiffness in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Resistance exercise has differing effects on arterial stiffness depending on type and intensity. Vigorous resistance training is associated with an increase in arterial stiffness. There seem to be no unfavourable effects on arterial stiffness if the training is of low intensity, in a slow eccentric manner or with lower limb in healthy individuals. Combined training has neutral or even a beneficial effect on arterial stiffness. In conclusion, our review shows that exercise training has varying effects on arterial stiffness depending on the exercise modalities.

The three exercise groups participated in 8 months of exercise training. Before, at 4 and at 8 months of the training period as well as at 1, 2 and 3 months after training cessation, muscle strength was measured and blood samples were collected. The resistance exercise caused significant increases mainly in muscle strength whereas aerobic exercise caused favourable effects mostly on lipid and apolipoprotein profiles. On the other hand, combined exercise caused significant favourable effects on both physiological (i.e. muscle strength) and biochemical (i.e. lipid and apolipoprotein profile and inflammation status) parameters, while the return to baseline values during the detraining period was slower compared to the other exercise modalities.

Progression models in resistance training for healthy adults.","American College of Sports Medicine","Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise",="01959131",,="20090301","41","3","687","22","105482406",,,"Journal Article",,,"In order to stimulate further adaptation toward specific training goals, progressive resistance training (RT) protocols are necessary. The optimal characteristics of strength-specific programs include the use of concentric (CON), eccentric (ECC), and isometric muscle actions and the performance of bilateral and unilateral single- and multiple-joint exercises. In addition, it is recommended that strength programs sequence exercises to optimize the preservation of exercise intensity (large before small muscle group exercises, multiple-joint exercises before single-joint exercises, and higher-intensity before lower-intensity exercises). For novice (untrained individuals with no RT experience or who have not trained for several years) training, it is recommended that loads correspond to a repetition range of an 8-12 repetition maximum (RM). For intermediate (individuals with approximately 6 months of consistent RT experience) to advanced (individuals with years of RT experience) training, it is recommended that individuals use a wider loading range from 1 to 12 RM in a periodized fashion with eventual emphasis on heavy loading (1-6 RM) using 3- to 5-min rest periods between sets performed at a moderate contraction velocity (1-2 s CON; 1-2 s ECC). When training at a specific RM load, it is recommended that 2-10% increase in load be applied when the individual can perform the current workload for one to two repetitions over the desired number. The recommendation for training frequency is 2-3 d x wk(-1) for novice training, 3-4 d x wk(-1) for intermediate training, and 4-5 d x wk(-1) for advanced training. Similar program designs are recommended for hypertrophy training with respect to exercise selection and frequency. For loading, it is recommended that loads corresponding to 1-12 RM be used in periodized fashion with emphasis on the 6-12 RM zone using 1- to 2-min rest periods between sets at a moderate velocity. Higher volume, multiple-set programs are recommended for maximizing hypertrophy. Progression in power training entails two general loading strategies: 1) strength training and 2) use of light loads (0-60% of 1 RM for lower body exercises; 30-60% of 1 RM for upper body exercises) performed at a fast contraction velocity with 3-5 min of rest between sets for multiple sets per exercise (three to five sets). It is also recommended that emphasis be placed on multiple-joint exercises especially those involving the total body. For local muscular endurance training, it is recommended that light to moderate loads (40-60% of 1 RM) be performed for high repetitions (>15) using short rest periods (<90 s). In the interpretation of this position stand as with prior ones, recommendations should be applied in context and should be contingent upon an individual's target goals, physical capacity, and training status.

As more individuals live longer, it is imperative to determine the extent and mechanisms by which exercise and physical activity can improve health, functional capacity, quality of life, and independence in this population. Aging is a complex process involving many variables (e.g., genetics, lifestyle factors, chronic diseases) that interact with one another, greatly influencing the manner in which we age. Participation in regular physical activity (both aerobic and strength exercises) elicits a number of favourable responses that contribute to healthy aging. Much has been learned recently regarding the adaptability of various biological systems, as well as the ways that regular exercise can influence them. Participation in a regular exercise program is an effective intervention/modality to reduce/prevent a number of functional declines associated with aging. Further, the trainability of older individuals (including octo- and nonagenarians) is evidenced by their ability to adapt and respond to both endurance and strength training. Endurance training can help maintain and improve various aspects of cardiovascular function (as measured by maximal VO2, cardiac output, and arteriovenous O2 difference), as well as enhance submaximal performance. Importantly, reductions in risk factors associated with disease states (heart disease, diabetes, etc.) improve health status and contribute to an increase in life expectancy. Strength training helps offset the loss in muscle mass and strength typically associated with normal aging. Additional benefits from regular exercise include improved bone health and, thus, reduction in risk for osteoporosis; improved postural stability, thereby reducing the risk of falling and associated injuries and fractures; and increased flexibility and range of motion. While not as abundant, the evidence also suggests that involvement in regular exercise can also provide a number of psychological benefits related to preserved cognitive function, alleviation of depression symptoms and behavior, and an improved concept of personal control and self-efficacy. It is important to note that while participation in physical activity may not always elicit increases in the traditional markers of physiological performance and fitness (e.g., VO2max, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, body composition) in older adults, it does improve health (reduction in disease risk factors) and functional capacity. Thus, the benefits associated with regular exercise and physical activity contribute to a more healthy, independent lifestyle, greatly improving the functional capacity and quality of life in this population.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH479950&site=ehost-live"

"An examination of rider arousal in the three phases of an equestrian combined training event.","Berno, K.A.",,,,="19920101",,,,,"SPH308045",,"Microform Publications, College of Human Development and Performance, University of Oregon","Microforms","HORSE sports; DRESSAGE; SHOW jumping; CROSS-country (Horsemanship); AROUSAL (Physiology); ANXIETY; SURVEYS; SELF-perception",,"This study examined the perceived optimal level of state anxiety/task type relationship. More specifically, this investigation was conducted to directly determine if different levels of multidimensional state anxiety were perceived to exist for peak performance in the three different phases (dressage, cross country and stadium jumping) of an equestrian combined training event. State anxiety was viewed retrospectively as a multidimensional construct by employing the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (Martens et. al., 1983). Two hypotheses were formed about the level of state anxiety. First, retrospectively perceived cognitive state anxiety would not differ across the three phases ofthe equestrian combined training event prior to the rider's best performance(s). Second, somatic state anxiety would be lowest for dressage, medium for stadiumjumping and highest for cross country prior to the competition. Data were collected, using a mailed questionnaire, from 200 equestrians randomly drawn from a national organization. One hundred fifteen riders returned the survey and the results revealed that their multidimensional state anxiety levels did indeed vary across the three phases (cognitive state anxiety, F(2, 218) is 6.03, p (less than) .003; somatic state anxiety, F(2, 204) is 9.53, p (less than) .005; self-confidence, F(2, 204) is 4.28, p (less than) .01). Moreover, because different levelsof state anxiety were perceived to exist, the Landers and Boutcher's (1986) task complexity scale, mailed to ten experts, was used to verify that task complexity differed for the three phases of the combined training event. It was predicted that the Landers and Boutcher task complexity scale would reveal that dressagewas the most complex task, while cross country would be the least complex task.Stadium jumping would have a total complexity score falling between these two events. The scale failed to differentiate complexity between the tasks (F(2, 10) is 256.49, p (greater than) .360). As a follow-up, the difference between the subject's self-perceived task complexity ratings of the three phases and their perceived optimal levels of multidimensional state anxiety were examined. Results revealed that there was a relationship between perceived task complexity and optimal state anxiety. Findings from this study lend support to the belief that tasktype and perception of task complexity are important variables in the arousal-performance relationship. It was also suggested that advancements must be made intask characteristic assessment procedures before further advances can be made in the area.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH308045&site=ehost-live"

Twenty-four university volunteers were equally divided into two groups: an experiment group (intensive combined training group) and a control (technical training) group. The 10-week intensive combined training program was performed on the experiment group according to their pretest outcomes. Before and at the end of each period of training, which was scheduled four times a week, the physical, physiological, biomotoric, and technical performance of each subject were determined. With respect to the pre- and posttest measurements, the basketball group showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in girth measurements (shoulder, waist, hip, arm, thigh, and calf), in skinfold measurements (percent body fat), in physiological measurements (vital capacity and forced vital capacity), in biomotoric tests (right-left hand grip, dynamic and countermovement jump, sit-up, push-up, 1500-m endurance), and in technique tests (free and inside shooting). It can be concluded that a 10-week intensive combined training program performed on university women basketball players had a significant effect on improving their physical, physiological, biomotoric, and technical features. It proved to be highly recommendable for female basketball players who are preparing for short-term tournaments; the basketball group in this study won a championship.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether anaerobic power of amateur mountain bikers changes during the first half of the competition season. Eight trained cyclists (mean ± SE: age: 22.0 ±0.5 years; height: 174.6 ± 0.9 cm; weight: 70.7 ± 2.6 kg) were subjected to an ergocycle incremental exercise test and to the Wingate test on two occasions: before, and in the middle of the season. After the incremental exercise test the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption was measured during 5-min recovery. Blood lactate concentration was measured in the 4th min after the Wingate test. Maximum oxygen uptake increased from 60.0 ± 1.5 ml · min-1 · kg-1 at the beginning of the season to 65.2 ± 1.4 ml · min-1 · kg-1 (P<0.05) in the season. Neither of the mechanical variables of the Wingate test nor excess post-exercise oxygen consumption values were significantly different in these two measurements. However, blood lactate concentration was significantly higher (P<0.001) in season (11.0 ± 0.5 mM) than before the season (8.6 ± 0.4 mM). It is concluded that: 1) despite the increase of cyclists' maximum oxygen uptake during the competition season their anaerobic power did not change; 2) blood lactate concentration measured at the 4th min after the Wingate test does not properly reflect training-induced changes in energy metabolism.

Methods A group of volunteers ( n = 5) trained in a hypobaric chamber at a simulated altitude of 2500 m (HYP), while the other ( n = 7), trained at sea level (NOR). Anaerobic power was tested before and after the training protocol through the widely used Bosco's vertical jump test procedures: squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ) and sixty seconds repeated maximal countermovement vertical jump (60CMJ). The mean height for the whole 60CMJ test (cm), partial heights every 5 and 15 sec were measured and the fatigue index (60CMJ/CMJ] was calculated. Results Hypoxic training significantly improved mean height for 60CMJ by 6.75% ( P = 0.029) in comparison to normoxic training. The fatigue index was also significantly lower ( P = 0.031) in the HYP group than in the NOR group. Partial heights at 45–60” intervals increased by 32.9% in the post-training test for the HYP group ( P = 0.004), compared to a lower improvement of 21.9% for the NOR group ( P = 0.022). Conclusions Our study shows a better anaerobic capacity after EST training at a moderate simulated altitude compared with that attained following the same training protocol at sea level.

In the first exercise intervention study to address this, a few months of resistance training significantly increased arterial stiffness in healthy men.[55] If the changes in arterial stiffness were mediated by resistance training, such changes should return to the baseline level when the stimuli of daily resistance exercise were removed. One of the most effective ways to maximize benefits from both aerobic exercise and resistance exercise seems to be the concurrent performance of both training (ie, cross-training).[68],[69] Theoretically, the opposing effects of aerobic and strength training exercise on central artery stiffness should negate the adverse effects of resistance training if aerobic exercise training effects equals or exceeds resistance training effects. This hybrid approach is consistent with the latest exercise guidelines suggesting concurrent practices of aerobic, resistance, and flexibility exercise training as the recommended approach to enhance both overall physical fitness and health.

For this purpose, 30 men aged 21.7 ± 2.4 years were assigned to the following three training groups: ET, which included continuous running with incremental intensity that was increased up to 80% of maximal heart rate (n = 10); RT, which included a beginning load of 50% of one repetition maximum (1RM) that was increased up to 80% of 1RM (n = 10); and CT, which included ET and RT programs every other day during the week (n = 10). Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in erythrocytes and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in plasma were measured. The results showed that SOD significantly increased by 21.85% (p = 0.020), 9.54% (p = 0.032), and 14.55% (p = 0.038) in the ET, RT, and CT groups, respectively. Furthermore, the activity of erythrocyte GPx significantly increased in the ET (p = 0.018) and CT (p = 0.042) groups. The TAC increased significantly in the ET (p = 0.040) and CT (p = 0.049) groups compared with the pretest values. The MDA level significantly decreased in the ET group by 32.7% (p = 0.028), by 32% in the RT group (p = 0.025), and by 29.1% (p = 0.047) in the CT group. However, there was no significant difference in the interaction of time and group between variables of SOD and GPx enzymes and TAC of plasma and MDA in the ET, RT, and CT groups ip < 0.05). It can be concluded that all three training types induced the same changes in redox state (increased SOD activity and reduction in MDA levels), but at different rates.

The objective of this study was to examine the application of multivariate longitudinal models in SIRT6, FBS, and BMI analysis in the elderly men after eight weeks concurrent training with supplementation of l-arginine (l-Arg). Methods: Thirty two elderly men with mean age of 63.09 ± 3.71 years were randomly divided into four equal-sized groups (each n = 8); Exercise + supplement (ES) group; exercise + placebo (EP) group; supplement (S) group and control (C) group. The ES and EP groups performed the eight weeks of concurrent training, three sessions per week. Group ES and group S consumed 1000 mg of l-Arg per day at 8:00 pm. Measurements of biochemical variables were done by ELISA Reader method. For analytical purposes, we used the paired sample t-test and multivariate longitudinal modeling with generalized estimating equation (GEE) methodology. All analyses have been implemented in R-3.4.1. p Values less than .05 were considered statistically significant. Results: With respect to significant association between sirt6, FBS, and BMI, this study showed that synergy effect of training and supplementation was greater than the sum of their individual effects on SIRT6 (β = 0.79, p < .001), FBS (β = -5.56, p = .022), and BMI (β = -3.89; p = .041). Also exercise alone had a significantly larger effect than supplementation alone on responses. Conclusions: It can be concluded that the joint usage of concurrent training and supplement of l-Arg for elderly men could improve the metabolism and body composition.

Twenty-three females and 11 males were assigned to one of three groups: ST/ET (n=15), ET/ST (n=15) or control (n=4). The 7-week training programme consisted of strength training using 10 exercises for two sets of 3-12 repetitions and running for 20-25 min at 60-90 percent of heart rate reserve. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was measured during a graded treadmill test, and muscular strength was assessed using one-repetition maximum tests for the bench press (BP), shoulder press (SP), arm curl (AC) and leg press (LP). The VO2max significantly increased 6.7 and 6.2 percent for the ST/ET and ET/ST groups, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two experimental groups. Muscular strength significantly improved by 15.2 percent (BP), 16.6 percent (SP), 17.2 percent (AC) and 11.9 percent (LP) for the ST/ET group and 19.9 percent (BP), 24.1 percent (SP), 20.9 percent (AC) and 14.0 percent (LP) for the ET/ST group. There were no significant differences between the two experimental groups for the BP, AC and LP; however, the ET/ST group increased SP strength more than the ST/EP group. In conclusion, adaptations to a combination of short-term endurance and strength training as assessed by VO2max and BP, AC and LP strength appear to be independent of whether endurance training occurs prior to or following strength training.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH350448&site=ehost-live"

However, research has not previously determined if physical work capacity is unique to traditional physiologic measures of fitness. Twenty-five healthy men and women completed a six-week HIFT intervention with physical work capacity and various physiologic measures of fitness assessed pre- and post-intervention. At baseline, these physiologic measures of fitness (e.g., aerobic capacity) were significantly associated with physical work capacity and this relationship was even stronger at post-intervention assessment. Further, there were significant improvements across these physiologic measures in response to the delivered intervention. However, the change in these physiologic measures failed to predict the change in physical work capacity induced via HIFT. These findings point to the potential utility of HIFT as a unique challenge to individuals’ physiology beyond traditional resistance or aerobic training. Elucidating the translational impact of increasing work capacity via HIFT may be of great interest to health and fitness practitioners ranging from strength/conditioning coaches to physical therapists.

This is a secondary analysis of our previously published randomized trials of aerobic, resistance, and combined training. We included 104 adolescents (body mass index (BMI) ≥85th percentile) who had complete baseline and post-intervention data for CRF, regional body fat, insulin sensitivity, and oral glucose tolerance. Associations between changes in body composition and CRF with cardiometabolic variables were examined adjusted for age, sex, Tanner stage, race, exercise group, and weight loss. At baseline, CRF, visceral fat and liver fat were correlated with insulin sensitivity with and without adjustment for BMI percentile. Training-associated changes in CRF, visceral fat, and liver fat were also correlated with insulin sensitivity changes, but not independent of body weight change. After accounting for body weight change, none of the body composition or CRF were associated with changes in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, systolic blood pressure, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although CRF and body composition were strong independent correlates of insulin sensitivity at baseline, changes in CRF and visceral fat were not associated with changes in insulin sensitivity after accounting for body weight change. Clinicaltrials.gov registration nos.: NCT00739180, NCT01323088, NCT01938950. Novelty With exercise training, changes in body weight, CRF, visceral fat, and liver fat were correlated with changes in insulin sensitivity. Changes in body composition or CRF generally did not remain significant correlates of changes in insulin sensitivity after adjusting for body weight changes.

Many of these functional tests as well as balance tests do not solely evaluate core function. • There are very few dynamic tests that measure core strength or power associated with the spectrum of human movement and specific to different sports (e.g. , soccer, basketball, etc.), and this is a crucial area for future research.

However, the association between different types of exercise training and blood pressure (BP) changes is not fully clear in type 2 diabetes. Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) was to determine the effects of structured exercise training (aerobic [AER], resistance [RES], or combined [COMB]) and physical activity (PA) advice only on BP changes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Searches in five electronic databases were conducted to retrieve studies published from 1980 to 2013. Eligible studies were RCTs consisting of structured exercise training or PA advice versus no intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes. We used random effect models to derive weighted mean differences (WMDs) of exercises on absolute changes in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). Results: A total of 30 RCTs of structured training (2,217 patients) and 21 of PA advice (7,323 patients) were included. Data were extracted independently in duplicate. Structured exercise was associated with reductions in SBP (WMD −4.22 mmHg; 95 % confidence interval [CI] −5.89 to −2.56) and DBP (WMD −2.07 mmHg; 95 % CI −3.03 to −1.11) versus controls. In structured exercise interventions, AER and RES were associated with declines in BP, and COMB was not associated with BP changes. However, in sensitivity analysis, a high-intensity protocol within COMB was associated with declines in SBP (WMD −3.30 mmHg; 95 % CI −4.71 to −1.89). Structured exercise longer than 150 min/week was associated with greater BP reductions. PA advice only was associated with reduction in SBP (WMD −2.97 mmHg; 95 % CI −4.52 to −1.43) and DBP (WMD −1.41 mmHg; 95 % CI −1.94 to −0.88) versus controls. Conclusions: AER, RES, and high-intensity combined training are associated with BP reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes, especially in exercise programs lasting more than 150 min/week. PA advice only is also associated with lower BP levels. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=99019869&site=ehost-live"

Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to establish the associations between training load and the tested variables. There was an almost certainly moderate increase for velocity at 2mM [ES= 0.86 (0.54; 1.18)], an almost certainly very large increase for velocity at 4mM [ES= 1.32 (0.94; 1.69)], an almost certainly large increase for peak treadmill velocity [ES= 1.11 (0.63; 1.58)], and a likely moderate increase for squat jump [ES= 0.37 (0.06; 0.69)] and countermovement jump [ES=0.45 (0.19; 0.72)]. Training load had a most likely large positive correlation to velocity at 4mM [r=0.74(0.46;0.89)], a likely moderate positive correlation to velocity at 2mM [r=0.39(-0.04;0.70] and a likely moderate negative correlation to squat jump (r=-0.33(-0.66;0.11). Training load has a strong positive correlation to improvements in aerobic endurance and weak negative correlation on improvements in strength/power. Prioritizing training goals and adjusting the dose of the training load will gauge endurance adaptations with as minimal as possible negative impact on strength/power adaptations.

Introduction: Low-intensity endurance training (ET) performed with blood flow restriction (BFR) can improve muscle strength, cross-sectional area (CSA) and cardiorespiratory capacity. Whether muscle strength and CSA as well as cardiorespiratory capacity (i.e., V˙O2max) and underlying molecular processes regulating such respective muscle adaptations are comparable to resistance and ET is unknown. Purpose: To determine the respective chronic (i.e., 8 wk) functional, morphological, and molecular responses of ET-BFR training compared with conventional, unrestricted resistance training (RT) and ET. Methods: Thirty healthy young men were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: ET-BFR (n = 10, 4 d·wk−1, 30-min cycling at 40% of V˙O2max), RT (n = 10, 4 d·wk−1, 4 sets of 10 repetitions leg press at 70% of one repetition maximum with 60 s rest) or ET (n = 10, 4 d·wk−1, 30-min cycling at 70% of V˙O2max) for 8 wk. Measures of quadriceps CSA, leg press one repetition maximum, and V˙O2max as well as muscle biopsies were obtained before and after intervention. Results: Both RT and ET-BFR increased muscle strength and hypertrophy responses. ET-BFR also increased V˙O2max, total cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1 abundance and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA abundance despite the lower work load compared to ET. Conclusions: Eight weeks of ET-BFR can increase muscle strength and induce similar muscle hypertrophy responses to RT while V˙O2max responses also increased postintervention even with a significantly lower work load compared with ET. Our findings provide new insight to some of the molecular mechanisms mediating adaptation responses with ET-BFR and the potential for this training protocol to improve muscle and cardiorespiratory capacity.

Similarly the load to be moved within strength exercise is normally calculated in relation to maximal strength. Both fitness abilities may be improved using the method of the subjective perception of stress. Within physical education this method is especially adequate to set an intensity level in running swimming or strength training. The method can be easily applied by the students and it improves their awareness of their own perception of stress.

We aimed to elucidate the time course of myonuclear dynamics during endurance training, loaded and concentric resistance training, and nerve silencing-induced disuse atrophy with subsequent recovery. We modified tibialis anterior muscle activity in free-living rats with electrical stimulation from implantable pulse generators, or with implantable osmotic pumps delivering tetrodotoxin (TTX) to silence the motor nerve without transection. We used the updated, automated software MyoVision to measure fiber-type-specific responses in whole tibialis anterior cross sections (~8,000 fibers each). Seven days of continuous low-frequency stimulation (CLFS) reduced muscle mass (-12%), increased slower myosin isoforms and reduced IIX/IIB fibers (-32%), and substantially increased myonuclei especially in IIX/IIB fibers (55.5%). High-load resistance training (spillover) produced greater hypertrophy (~16%) in muscle mass and fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) than low-load resistance training (concentric, ~6%) and was associated with myonuclear addition in all fiber types (35%-46%). TTX-induced nerve silencing resulted in progressive loss in muscle mass, fiber CSA, and myonuclei per fiber cross section (-50.7%, -53.7%, and -40.7%, respectively, at 14 days). Myonuclear loss occurred in a fiber-type-independent manner, but subsequent recovery during voluntary habitual activity suggested that type IIX/IIB fibers contained more new myonuclei during recovery from severe atrophy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate autonomic modulation in active and sedentary renal transplant recipients. Twenty renal-transplanted individuals were analyzed at the Centro de Prevenção de Doenças Renais (Kidney Disease Education Centre), in the academic hospital of Universidade Federal do Maranhão, and were divided into the active group (AG) and the sedentary group (SG). The AG comprised of six men and four women (age 43.10 ± 13.02) and was in regular concurrent training intervention for 8 weeks, while the SG was composed of three men and seven women (age 36.8 ± 9.26). Analysis of heart rate (HR) variability in time and frequency domain demonstrated that HR mean values in the SG and AG were 787.32 ± 79.60 and 870 ± 106.66 ms, respectively. Differences were observed in the time domain and frequency domain. The total index of low frequency and high frequency showed no differences between the SG and AG. Biochemical variables presented significantly lower levels after 8 weeks of training. Higher heart rate variability in the time domain and greater vagal modulation was observed in the AG. The AG ad greater vagal modulation when compared to the SG, with removal of the sympathetic and increased parasympathetic in the behaviour was confirmed by sympatho-vagal balance. The AG also presented significant improvements in the frequency domain. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=111359175&site=ehost-live"

Methods: Forty eight participants with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to aerobic training on cycle ergometer (AT-group), resistance training of the lower extremities (RT-group), or sham training of upper extremities (ST-group). Participants exercised 3 d/week for 12 weeks. Balance (Berg Balance Scale), peak oxygen uptake rate, isometric knee extensor strength, maximal gait speed, and 6 minute walk test were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. Results: Training specific effects were observed; the AT-group improved peak oxygen uptake rate by 15.5 (6.0-25.0)%, the RT-group improved non-paretic knee extensor strength by 35.1 (18.3-51.9)% and the ST-group improved non-paretic knee extensor strength by 8.9 (0.7-17.1)%. All groups improved balance (6.0 (95% CI: 3.2-8.8)%), maximal gait speed (10.2 (6.5-14.0)%), and 6 minute walk distance (12.4 (8.8-15.9)%) but balance improvements did not correlate with improvements in muscle strength, peak oxygen uptake rate, or walking. Conclusions: Physical exercise improves balance and walking performance, but improved balance is not a prerequisite for functional improvements in chronic stroke. Implications for Rehabilitation: Aerobic training and progressive resistance training show small significant improvements in balance and walking, indicating a possible clinical relevance of these training modalities. Improvements in balance may not be a prerequisite for improvements in walking distance when assistive devices are allowed during walking tests.

In this short review, we speculate that the lack of daily physical activity induces evolutionarily selected mechanisms to use or lose, one of which is related to nutritional status.

The majority of the research studies done on this topic have been of a cross-sectional design. PURPOSE: To measure physiological benefits of a university karate class. METHODS: Ten healthy women (age 20.8 ± 0.6 y, body weight 58.9 ± 2.4 kg, and height 163.8 ± 2.2 cm) with no previous martial arts experience volunteered to participate in the project. Class sessions met twice per week for 50 minutes each session. In each class 7-10 minutes were devoted to warm-up/stretching activities, 15-20 minutes to karate fundamentals, 10-15 minutes to kata or forms, and 5-10 minutes of self defense activities. Testing was done the first week of the class and during the last week of the 8 week course. Subjects were assessed for body composition (via Bod Pod), flexibility (modified sit-and-reach test), handgrip strength, and aerobic capacity (graded exercise treadmill test). RESULTS: No significant differences due to the training were found for weight or body composition. Subjects demonstrated higher, although not significantly so, values for handgrip strength post training. Mean flexibility was significantly greater (25.5 ± 3.3 cm vs 28.4 ± 3.2 cm) after karate training. Aerobic capacity was significantly higher (34.4 ± 1.8 ml/kg/min vs 36.5 ± 1.7 ml/kg/min) after training. CONCLUSION: An eight week university karate class resulted in no change in weight, body composition nor handgrip strength in a group of women. A significant increase in trunk flexibility and aerobic capacity was seen for the subjects, however. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Eight weeks may not be adequate time to demonstrate the impact of karate training on certain markers of fitness. Handgrip strength was improved in the group, however not enough to demonstrate statistical significance. This type of training was beneficial in increasing both trunk flexibility and aerobic capacity. A longer duration study may allow for greater evidence of the full benefits of karate training.

One of the most promising new cancer therapies in recent years is immunotherapy, which is based on the blockade of immune checkpoints such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Exercise training is beneficial to maintain and improve the quality of life of cancer patients, and it might also modulate the anti-tumoral efficiency of some chemotherapeutic agents. However, the potential of exercise combined with immunotherapy as a cancer therapy remains to be elucidated. Here, we examined the effects of exercise on tumor growth and its possible adjuvant effects when combined with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (nivolumab) in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Methods: We generated a PDX model using NOD-SCID gamma mice with subcutaneous grafts from tumor tissue of a patient with NSCLC. Animals were randomly assigned to one of four groups: non-exercise + isotype control (n=5), exercise + isotype control (n=5), non-exercise + nivolumab (n=6) or exercise + nivolumab (n=6). The animals undertook an 8-week moderate-intensity training regimen (treadmill aerobic exercise and strength training). Immunotherapy (nivolumab) or an isotype control was administered 2 days/week, for 6 weeks. Several tumor growth and microenvironment parameters were measured after the intervention. Results: Improvements in aerobic capacity and muscle strength (p=0.027 andp=0.005) were noted in exercised animals. Exercise alone reduced the tumor growth rate with respect to non-exercised mice (p=0.050). The double intervention (exercise + nivolumab) increased tumor necrosis and reduced apoptosis with respect to controls (p=0.026; p=0.030). All interventions achieved a reduction in proliferation compared with the control group (p=0.015, p=0.011, and p=0.011). Exercise alone increased myeloid tumor infiltrates (mostly neutrophils) with respect to the nivolumab only group (p=0.018). Finally, Vegf-a expression was higher in the nivolumab groups (in combination or not with exercise) than in exercise + isotype control group (p=0.045 and p=0.047, respectively). No other significant effects were found. Conclusions: Our results would suggest that aerobic and strength training should be studied as an adjuvant to cancer immunotherapy treatment.

However, its further dissemination and implementation demands serious scientific biological underpinnings. More specifically, the fundamental scientific concepts of homeostatic regulation, stress adaptation and the law of supercompensation determine the biological essence and content of appropriate block mesocycles, i.e., the accumulation, transmutation and realization cycles, respectively. Such a separation is intended to prevent conflicting physiological responses and provide a favorable interaction for training effects. Several studies have evaluated the metabolic effects of various training programs, and the superiority of the BP model has been confirmed in terms of significant gains of maximal oxygen uptake, maximal power output and positive trends in athletic performance. It was found that the endocrine status of athletes is strictly dependent on appropriate blocks such as voluminous extensive workloads combined with resistance training (accumulation), lower-volume intense training (transmutation), and event-specific precompetitive training (realization). Evidence from molecular biology indicates the major regulators that determine meaningful adaptive events within specific block mesocycles. Specifically, voluminous extensive accumulation blocks stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and protein synthesis in slow-twitch muscle fibres, whereas lower-volume intense workloads of the transmutation blocks evoke adaptive modifications in fast-twitch glycolytic and oxidative-glycolytic muscle fibers. Furthermore, such a training program causes a remarkable elevation of myonuclear content in muscle fibers that enables athletes to regain previously acquired abilities. The precompetitive realization block produces accentuated expression of stress-related and myogenic genes that affect protein synthesis and increase muscle glycogen. In addition, such a program stimulates and increases the size, force and power of fast-twitch fibers.

As such, training is associated with a potential interference effect. The present study randomized well‐trained ice hockey players into a block periodization group (BP; n = 8), focusing on the development of either strength and power or endurance on a weekly, undulating basis, and a traditional group (TRAD; n = 8), performing a mixed training model, with simultaneous focus of strength, power, and endurance training every week. During the 6‐week intervention, the two groups performed equal volumes and intensities of both strength, power, and endurance training. BP led to larger improvements than TRAD in knee extension peak torque at 180° s−1 (6.6 ± 8.7 vs −4.2% ± 6.3%, respectively; P < 0.05) and maximal oxygen uptake (5.1 ± 3.3 vs 1.1% ± 3.5%, respectively; P < 0.05). There was also a trend toward larger improvements in BP than TRAD in peak torque in knee extension at 60° s−1 (2.1 ± 2.5 vs −0.1% ± 2.5%, respectively; P < 0.1, effect size = 0.83) and mean power output during a 30‐s cycling sprint (4.1 ± 2.5 vs −0.3% ± 5.9%, respectively; P < 0.1, effect size = 0.89). Overall, BP exhibited a moderate to large effect size for all these variables compared to TRAD. The present study suggests that block periodization of strength and endurance training induces superior adaptations in both strength and endurance capacities in well‐trained ice hockey players compared to traditional mixed organization, despite similar training volume and intensity.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of block training periodization on maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and parameters of exercise performance in elite junior alpine skiers. Six female and 15 male athletes were assigned to high-intensity interval (IT, N = 13) or control training groups (CT, N = 8). IT performed 15 high-intensity aerobic interval (HIT) sessions in 11 days. Sessions were 4 x 4 min at 90-95% of maximal heart rate separated by 3-min recovery periods. CT continued their conventionally mixed training, containing endurance and strength sessions. Before and 7 days after training, subjects performed a ramp incremental test followed by a high-intensity time-to-exhaustion (tlim) test both on a cycle ergometer, a 90-s high-box jump test as well as countermovement (CMJ) and squat jumps (SJ) on a force plate. IT significantly improved relative VO2max by 6.0% (P < 0.01; male +7.5%, female +2.1%), relative peak power output by 5.5% (P < 0.01) and power output at ventilatory threshold 2 by 9.6% (P < 0.01). No changes occurred for these measures in CT. tlim remained unchanged in both groups. High-box jump performance was significantly improved in males of IT only (4.9%, P < 0.05). Jump peak power (CMJ -4.8%, SJ -4.1%; P < 0.01), but not height decreased in IT only. For competitive alpine skiers, block periodization of HIT offers a promising way to efficiently improve VO2max and performance. Compromised explosive jump performance might be associated with persisting muscle fatigue.

However, there may be a point where the training load becomes too low to stimulate an anabolic response without BFR. This study examined skeletal muscle adaptions to very low-load resistance exercise with and without BFR. Changes in muscle thickness (MTH), strength, and endurance were examined following 8-weeks of training with a traditional high-load [70% 1RM,(7000)], low-load [15% 1RM,(1500)], low-load with moderate BFR [15%1RM + 40%BFR(1540)], or low-load with greater BFR [15% 1RM + 80%BFR(1580)]. 1RM strength changes were greater in the 7000 condition [2.09 (95% CI = 1.35–2.83) kg] compared to all low-load conditions. For isometric and isokinetic strength, there were no changes. For endurance, there was a main effect for time [mean pre to post change = 7.9 (4.3–11.6) repetitions]. At the 50% site, the mean change in MTH in the 7000 condition [0.16 (0.10–0.22) cm] was greater than all low-load conditions. For the 60% site, the mean change in MTH [0.15 (0.08–0.22)] was greater than all low-load conditions. For the 70% site there was a main effect for time [mean pre to post change = 0.09 (0.05–0.14 cm]. All groups increased muscle size; however, this response was less in all very low training conditions compared to high-load training. 1RM strength increased in the 7000 condition only, with no other changes in strength observed.

However, less research has been conducted in younger populations to determine at what age CVD risk develops. The purpose of this study is to compare cardiovascular health markers in adults, specifically CVD risk between younger adults aged 18-22 and a slightly older group of adults in middle adulthood aged 23-54. Cardiovascular health measures were collected from a group of adults; 13 younger adults (20.2±0.9 yrs) and 10 adults in middle adulthood (42.9±10.1 yrs). All participants were free of CVD and diabetes, taking no cholesterol medication, and no more than one blood pressure (BP) medication. Cardiovascular measures included clinical and 24-hour BP, body mass index (BMI), fasted plasma glucose and cholesterol levels, and VO2max. There was no difference in VO2max, glucose and cholesterol levels, or clinical BP measures between the groups, but there were differences in diastolic 24-hour BP, daytime diastolic BP, and nighttime diastolic BP (p<0.05 for all). No relationship between 24-hour BP and cardiovascular health variables were observed in the younger group of adults. However, there was a relationship between 24-hour systolic BP and daytime systolic BP with glucose, HDL, and triglycerides in the group of adults aged 23-54 (p<0.05 for all). The results of the present study suggest that systolic BP may have an effect on CVD risk in adults over the age of 23 years.

The HR increase was accompanied by changes in HRV after sessions of STS (p <0.01), ASTS (p <0.01) and SATS (p <0.01) compared to the CON group. Conclusions: Combined sessions of aerobic and strength training with moderate intensity can elicit a hypotensive response in normotensive men independent of session order. Therefore strength and conditioning professionals can prescribe these exercises using different orders if the objective of the training session is to control blood pressure.

Low-load blood flow restriction strength training (LL-BFRT) was applied to prepare for and increase tolerability of subsequently applied high-load strength training. Methods (Case Description) A 62-year-old woman with COPD GOLD 2 B presented with severe breathlessness. Lower limb strength was severely reduced while functional exercise capacity was preserved. The patient was severely load compromised and had high risk to be intolerant of the high training loads required to trigger the desired adaptations. LL-BFRT was applied during the first 12 training sessions and high-load strength training in the subsequent 12 training sessions of the rehabilitation program. Endurance training on a cycle ergometer was performed throughout the program. Results Symptom burden in the COPD assessment test was reduced by 6 points (40%). Lower limb strength improved by 95.3 Nm (521%) and 88.4 Nm (433%) for the knee extensors and by 33.8 Nm (95%) and 56 Nm (184%) for the knee flexors, respectively. Functional exercise capacity improved by 44 m (11%) in the 6-minute walk test and 14 repetitions (108%) in the 1-minute sit-to stand test. The patient did not experience any adverse events related to the exercise training. Conclusion Clinically relevant changes were observed in both strength-related functional and self-reported outcomes. The achievements translated well into daily living and enabled functioning according to the patients' desires. LL-BFRT was reported to be well tolerated and implementable into an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. Impact The description of this case encourages the systematic investigation of LL-BFRT in COPD. LL-BFRT has the potential to increase benefits as well as tolerability of strength training in pulmonary rehabilitation. Consideration of the physiological changes achieved through LL-BFRT highlights potential in targeting peripheral muscle dysfunction in COPD.

The aim of this study was to assess changes in arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics, and their relationship to exercising SV, after 3 wk of overload training. Methods: Twenty-six cyclists and triathletes completed 3 wk of either regular training (CON; n = 13) or overload training (OL; n = 13). Testing took place before (PRE) and after regular or overload training (POST). Resting measures included brachial blood pressure, HR, carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) to assess arterial stiffness, and carotid pulse wave analysis to assess wave reflections and central hemodynamics. An incremental cycle test was used to assess peak power, maximal HR, and maximal lactate to assess overtraining status. Cardiac output (Q˙), SV, and HR were assessed using cardiac impedance. Results: Resting arterial stiffness was unaltered in CON but increased with OL after increased training (CON −0.1 ± 0.6 m·s−1 vs OL +0.5 ± 0.8 m·s−1, P = 0.04). Resting blood pressure and central hemodynamics, including aortic pressures, augmentation index, and subendocardial viability ratio, did not change (all P > 0.05). Maximal SV (CON +3 mL vs OL −9 mL, P = 0.04), HR (CON −2 ± 4 bpm vs OL −9 ± 3 bpm, P < 0.001), and Q˙ (CON +0.32 L·min−1 vs OL −1.75 L·min−1, P = 0.01) decreased with OL from PRE to POST. A significant inverse relationship existed between changes in PWV and maximal Q˙ (r = −0.44, P = 0.04) and changes in PWV and peak power (r = −0.48, P = 0.01), and trended for SV and PWV (r = −0.41, P = 0.055). Conclusions: Overload training results in increased resting arterial stiffness and reduced SV during exercise, with no changes to resting central hemodynamics.

We also compared the usefulness of different methods for the analysis of body composition to detect training-induced adaptations. METHODS: Fifty-three men were randomized into the endurance training (E: N = 14), strength training (S: N = 13), combined strength and endurance training (SE: N = 15), or control (C: N = 11) groups. S and E trained 2 and SE 2 x 2 times a week for strength and endurance. RESULTS: Percentage of fat (fat%) decreased (5-8%) similarly in all training groups. Fat% measured by DXA at baseline and its change correlated with those recorded by bioimpedance (r = 0.90 and 0.66), skinfolds (r = 0.80 and 0.78), and waistline (r = 0.84 and 0.74). Lean mass in legs (DXA) increased only in S (2.0 +/- 1.5%, P < 0.001), but the thickness of vastus lateralis and intermedius measured by ultrasound increased (7-11%) in all training groups, and that of triceps brachii increased in S (22%) and SE (20%). Maximal concentric force increased significantly in S, SE, and E (by 22, 23, and 7%), and maximal oxygen uptake increased in both E (11%) and SE (11%). CONCLUSIONS: Waist circumference and skinfold thickness seem to reasonably assess changes in percent body fat during training. However, only DXA was capable to separate small differences between the groups in training-induced changes in lean body mass. Combined strength and endurance training is of greater value than either alone in optimizing body composition or improving physical fitness in older men.

Accuracy of BIA and skinfold thickness in estimating body composition among 39-64 year-old women was investigated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a criterion method both cross-sectionally and during a training intervention. Methods: 97 women had percentage of fat assessed using DXA, skinfolds and eight-polar BIA using multi-frequency current. Fat mass and lean mass were estimated by DXA and BIA. Measurements were performed before and after the 21-week training intervention. Results: At baseline relative to DXA, BIA under predicted percentage of fat (−6.50 %) and fat mass (−3.42 kg) and overestimated lean mass (3.18 kg) considerably. Also skinfold measurement under predicted percentage of fat compared to DXA, but the difference was smaller (−1.69 % units). Skinfold measurement overestimated percentage of fat at low values and underestimated at high values ( r = 0.535). A significant bias was detected between DXA and BIA's estimate of change in percentage of fat, fat mass and lean mass. Compared to DXA, BIA and skinfolds underestimated the training-induced positive changes in body composition. Conclusions: BIA and skinfold methods compared to DXA are not interchangeable to quantify the percentage of fat, fat mass and lean mass at the cross-sectional design in middle-aged women. Moreover, exercise training-induced small changes in body composition cannot be detected with BIA or skinfold method, even though DXA was able to measure statistically significant within-group changes in body composition after training.

Subjects (n = 62) were randomized into endurance training (E), strength training (S), combined strength and endurance training (SE), or control groups (C). S and E trained 2 and SE 2 + 2 times in a week. Muscle strength and maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max) were measured. Leg extension strength increased 9 +/- 8% in S (P < 0.001), 12 +/- 8% in SE (P < 0.001) and 3 +/- 4% in E (P = 0.036), and isometric bench press 20% only in both S and SE (P < 0.001).

The changes in the total body fat (dual X-ray absorptiometry) did not differ between groups, but significant decreases were observed in E (-5.9%, P = 0.022) and SE (-4.8%, P = 0.005). Lean mass of the legs increased 2.2-2.9% (P = 0.004-0.010) in S, SE and E. There were no differences between the groups in the changes in blood lipids, blood pressure or serum glucose and insulin. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in E. Both S and SE showed small decreases in serum fasting insulin. Both endurance and strength training and their combination led to expected training-specific improvements in physical fitness, without interference in fitness or muscle mass development. All training methods led to increases in lean body mass, but decreases in body fat and modest improvements in metabolic risk factors were more evident with aerobic training than strength training.

Among the possibilities of exercise, bodyweight training (BWT) has been highlighted in the last years as a safe option to improve the health of older people. We compared the effects of 24 weeks of BWT and combined training (CT) on low-grade systematic inflammation and functional fitness in postmenopausal women. For this, 40 women were allocated and submitted to CT (n = 20, 64.43 ± 3.13 years, 29.56 ± 4.80 kg/m²) and BWT (n = 20, 65.10 ± 4.86 years, 28.76 ± 4.26 kg/m²). We measured inflammation by the interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) assessments. For functional fitness, we used tests similar to activities of daily living. At the end of the 16 weeks, data from 24 women were analyzed, CT (n = 14) and BT (n = 10). Both groups reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels, without differences in IL-10. Regarding functional fitness, both groups demonstrated improvements in all tests after 24 weeks, except for rise from prone position and the 400-meter walk test for CT. In summary, CT and BWT are effective in reducing the plasma concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improving functional fitness in postmenopausal women.

"BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS: STRENGTH TRAINING IN LONG DISTANCE TRIATHLETES.","Luckin, Kate M.; Badenhorst, C.; Cripps, A.; Landers, G.; Merrells, R.; Bulsara, M.; Hoyne, G.","Journal of Australian Strength & Conditioning",="18357644",,="20171015","25","6","20","1","135834907",,,"Article","TRIATHLETES; STRENGTH training; CYCLING; TRIATHLON training; DATA analysis",,"INTRODUCTION: Long distance triathletes complete large endurance training volumes with approximately half reporting to including some form of strength training (ST) in their program. However, the characteristics of this ST is currently unknown. Despite not all triathletes incorporating ST, research indicates that the completion of concurrent strength and endurance training in runners, cyclists and short course triathletes can significantly improve cycling and running economy and potentially reduce injury occurrence, likely resulting in performance improvements. Previous research has hypothesised barriers to ST in endurance athletes, however there is no empirical evidence to support such hypotheses. Therefore the primary aims of this investigation were to identify perceived barriers towards the completion of ST in long distance triathletes and ST characteristics. It was hypothesised that long distance triathletes would report limited time available for ST and fear of hypertrophy limiting their endurance performance as primary barriers to ST completion. METHODS: Three hundred and ninety long distance triathletes (224 females, 166 males; age: 39 ± 10 y) completed a 68 question self-administered survey assessing endurance and ST characteristics, triathlon experience and perceived barriers regarding the completion of ST. Data was analysed using Stata v.14 examining descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation), frequencies (percentages) and Chi Squared (>2). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: Participants completed 14.9 ± 5.2 h.wk-1 of triathlon training with 54.6% reporting participation in a form of ST. Heavy strength (HS) training (3 - 5 sets of 1 - 6 repetitions at > 80% 1RM) was the most commonly reported form of ST (39.4%). Participants who did not complete ST reported perceived time restraints (53.1%) and lack of knowledge on exercise type, progression and technique (52.5%) as prominent perceived barriers to ST completion. Concern for increases in body weight due to ST was only reported by 5.1% of participants. DISCUSSION: Results from this study confirm our initial hypothesis as time restraints was a primary perceived barrier preventing ST completion. A novel result of this investigation was that triathletes may not have sufficient knowledge regarding ST types and parameters. This result was supported by the majority of participants listing HS as their form of ST, however, 62.6% of HS exercises described by participants did not conform to a standard definition of HS training. In contrast to our hypothesis the concern of increasing muscle mass was not a primary perceptual barrier to ST completion. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Identification of these perceived barriers may be helpful for coaches, triathletes and sports scientists who want to include ST for injury prevention and performance improvement. It is recommended that an emphasis should be placed on educating both triathletes and coaches on the types, progressions and technique of strength exercises to ensure it can be correctly incorporated into a training program.

"Brief intense interval exercise activates AMPK and p38 MAPK signaling and increases the expression of PGC-1α in human skeletal muscle.","Gibala, Martin J.; McGee, Sean L.; Garnham, Andrew P.; Howlett, Kirsten F.; Snow, Rodney J.; Hargreaves, Mark","Journal of Applied Physiology",="87507587",,="20090301","106","3","929","6","37006781",,,"Article","MESSENGER RNA; PROTEIN kinases; PHYSIOLOGY; CHEMICAL reactions; CLINICAL pathology",,"From a cell signaling perspective, short-duration intense muscular work is typically associated with resistance training and linked to pathways that stimulate growth. However, brief repeated sessions of sprint or high-intensity interval exercise induce rapid phenotypic changes that resemble traditional endurance training. We tested the hypothesis that an acute session of intense intermittent cycle exercise would activate signaling cascades linked to mitochondrial biogenesis in human skeletal muscle. Biopsies (vastus lateralis) were obtained from six young men who performed four 30-s ""all out"" exercise bouts interspersed with 4 mm of rest (<80 kJ total work). Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK; subunits α1 and α2) and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was higher (P ≤ 0.05) immediately after bout 4 vs. preexercise. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-κ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) mRNA was increased approximately twofold above rest after 3 h of recovery (P ≤ 0.05); however, PGC-1α protein content was unchanged. In contrast, phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt (Thr308 and Ser473) tended to decrease, and downstream targets linked to hypertrophy (p70 ribosomal S6 kinase and 4E binding protein 1) were unchanged after exercise and recovery. We conclude that signaling through AMPK and p38 MAPK to PGC-1α may explain in part the metabolic remodeling induced by low-volume intense interval exercise, including mitochondrial biogenesis and an increased capacity for glucose and fatty acid oxidation.

Training consisted of 30-45 min of cycle ergometry at 50-70% maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), 3 times weekly for 16 wk, then 4 wk detraining, or assignment to a nontraining control group (n = 12 both groups). Training increased leg strength, leg power, upper leg muscle mass, and VO2max above pretraining values (21%, 12%, 4%, and 15%, respectively; p < .05). However, all gains were lost after detraining, except for some gain in VO2max. This suggests that cycle ergometry is sufficient stimulus to improve neuromuscular function in older men, but gains are quickly lost with detraining. For the older population cycle ergometry provides the means to not only increase aerobic fitness but also increase leg strength and power and upper leg muscle mass. However, during periods of inactivity neuromuscular gains are quickly lost. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=47197347&site=ehost-live"

After an electronic search, nine peer-reviewed articles were considered, including soccer players from junior to professional-level (age 14 - 23 years). One study was conducted during the pre-season, seven studies during the in-season, and one study during the off-season period of a competitive schedule. The studies included were of moderate to high methodological quality (PEDro scale) and incorporated CT with soccer practice. Large significant improvements (ES = 1.30; 95% CI = 0.61 - 2.00; p < 0.001; I2 = 80.6%) for maximal strength, and small non-significant improvements for aerobic endurance (ES = 0.33; 95% CI = -0.19 - 0.85; p = 0.209; I2 = 0.0%) and RSA (ES = 0.32; 95% CI = -0.12 - 0.75; p = 0.156; I2 = 0.0%) were noted for CT groups when compared to active or specific-active control groups. Therefore, supplementing regular soccer training with CT induces adaptations to improve maximal strength. CT may be implemented during the pre-season and in-season to induce adaptations similar to traditional strength training (e.g., maximal strength gains), although alternative training strategies may be needed to further improve aerobic endurance and RSA. The use of CT may be applicable during different periods of the season to achieve certain goals, e.g., pre- and in-season for maximal strength development, and off-season to attenuate the decline of strength or power.

In addition, we examined the effects of experimental design, training protocol, gender, age, and testing procedures on the VO2max of children. Past research used in the analyses were delimited to studies examining the effects of various forms of muscular strength and endurance training in children <13 years, resulting in a total of 91 studies. However, as numerous studies failed to provide sufficient information or adequate statistics, the final pool of research was confined to 20 studies with 32 effect sizes (ES), totaling 562 subjects. Studies which utilized a control group generated a mean pre-post training ES of 1.1±0.1, compared to a mean ES of 0.32±0.2 from those in which subjects served as their own controls (p<0.0009). Studies that were cross sectional (XS) typically reported a higher VO2max in the trained group (ES=1.7± 0.3) compared to pre-to-post test designs (ES = 0.63±0.6). Analyses of the subjects characteristics indicated that children in the 8 to 10 year old (ES=0.47±0.4) range were trainable; however not nearly to the same extent as their 11 to 13 year old counterparts (ES=1.1±0.7, p<0.02). The mean ES for girls and boys was 1.0±0.6 and 0.64±0.9, respectively. An analysis of investigations which utilized a sufficiently intense training stimulus, vs. an inadequate training stimulus, resulted in significant improvements in VO2max after training (ES=0.33±0.2vs. ES=1.2±0.5, p<0.0004). Children improved their VO2max by an average of 6.0% (47.1±4.3 versus 50.1±4.6) after training. The results of this quantitative review indicate that children are indeed trainable, but the changes in VO2max are modest and are significantly impacted by the experimental design of the investigation, the age of the children, and the nature of training stimulus.

The aim of this study was to analyze whether hepatic steatosis interferes in the effect of physical exercise on the body composition of obese children and adolescents. The sample consists of 40 obese individuals, 13 children (8.17±1.33 years) and 27 adolescents (12.28±1.36 years). Total and segmental body composition was estimated by DEXA. Anthropometric measurements were performed, as well as ultrasound examination of the liver to measure intra-abdominal and subcutaneous fat, and to diagnose hepatic steatosis (HS). The intervention consisted of 20 weeks, with recreational/competitive activities being applied to children and, for adolescents, concurrent training (aerobic and resistance). The Levene's, repeated-measures ANOVA and effect size tests (ES) by Eta-Squared were performed. It was observed that, although not statistically significant, analyzing the effect size, physical activity in both children (body fat ES effect time= 0.210 and ES effect group= 0.208; fat mass ES effect group= 0.338; fat android ES effect Interaction= 0.267), and adolescents (intra-abdominal fat ES effect group= 0.230) regardless of whether or not HS was effective in reducing body fat. Therefore, exercise was effective in improving the body composition of obese children and adolescents, regardless of HS.

Twenty-three subjects from the university's football team were recruited from an Exercise Science 100 conditioning class to participate in a 15-week off-season training program. Phase I consisted of concurrent strength and speed/endurance training (3-4 d·wk) for 7 weeks. Phase II consisted of strength training and spring football practice (3-4 d·wk) for 4 weeks. Countermovement jump, estimated one repetition maximum (1RM) bench press and back squat, 505 change of direction (COD), repeated 30-yard anaerobic sprint test (RAST), and body mass were all measured Pre, Mid, and Post training program. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed no significant interaction between linemen and nonline players for all performance variables (p > 0.05). Over the course of the study, RSAT % decrement, 505 COD times, and estimated 1RM performance for bench and squat significantly improved (p ≤ 0.05). No significant changes were detected in CMJ, RSAT best time, or body mass. Results indicate that linemen and non-line players did not respond significantly different to the present training program. The 15-week training program produced improvements in COD skill, speed, anaerobic capacity, and muscular strength. Furthermore, all performance changes were maintained through the end of the study.

The interindividual variability in Vpeak/Wpeak has been attributed to exercise economy, anaerobic capacity, and neuromuscular capability, alongside the major determinant of aerobic capacity. Interestingly, findings after concurrent strength and endurance training performed by endurance athletes have challenged the actual contribution of these variables. The critical power model usually derived from the performance of constant-work rate exercise can also explain tolerance to a ramp incremental exercise so that, Vpeak/Wpeak can be predicted accurately. However, there is not yet discussion of possible concomitant improvements in the parameters of the critical power model and Vpeak/Wpeak after concurrent training and whether they can be associated with and therefore depend on different neuromuscular adaptations. Therefore, this brief review presents some evidence that the critical power model could explain the improvement of Vpeak/Wpeak and should be used to monitor aerobic performance enhancement after different concurrent strength- and endurance-training designs.

Study participants were 14 runners (18-35 years) who had training prescribed with peak velocity (<italic>V</italic>peak) and its time limit (<italic>t</italic>lim). Three tests were performed on a treadmill: two maximum incrementals for VO2max and <italic>V</italic>peak and one for <italic>t</italic>lim. The 10-km running performance was evaluated on a 400-m track. The mean velocity, heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were monitored at each trial of 10-km running performance. Evaluations were collected pre and after 4 weeks of endurance training. The RPE and HR increased linearly throughout the test, and the risk of fatigue decreased after 3 km. The pacing strategy used by the participants was the “U” running pace in pre- and post-training. There was improvement in the 10-km run after training (40.8 ± 2.8 vs. 39.6 ± 2.7 min). The study showed that 4 weeks of endurance training does not change the pacing strategy and the risk of premature fatigue.

Purpose: Exercise guidelines recommend incorporating resistance exercise (RE) into a regular aerobic training program during pregnancy. However, few women do so because of uncertainties about the safety of prenatal RE, particularly regarding the Valsalva maneuver (VM). The aim of this study was to determine the acute cardiovascular responses to prenatal RE at different intensities, with and without VM. Methods: Healthy pregnant (n = 15; 22.9 ± 5.9 wk of gestation) and nonpregnant women (n = 15) were recruited. Maximal strength over 10 repetitions (10RM) for semireclined leg press was determined. Women underwent standardized assessments of cardiac structure, function and mechanics (echocardiography), heart rate (ECG), and blood pressure (photoplethysmography) at baseline, during RE at 20%, 40%, and 60% 10RM while free-breathing, and at 40% 10RM with VM. Significant differences were identified between subjects at baseline (independent t -tests), between and within subjects during free-breathing RE (general linear model, baseline as a covariate), and between and within subjects for 40% 10RM free-breathing versus VM (mixed-effects model). Results: Resting cardiac output, heart rate, and stroke volume were greater in pregnant women, without differences in blood pressure, ejection fraction, or cardiac mechanics. During free-breathing RE, pregnant women had a greater ejection fraction compared with nonpregnant women; however, all other hemodynamic variables were not different between groups. Cardiac mechanics during free-breathing RE across all intensities were not different between groups, with the exception that pregnant women had a lower apical circumferential strain that did not affect global cardiac function. No differences were observed between groups during 40% 10RM RE with and without VM. Conclusions: Pregnant women have proportionate cardiac responses to light-moderate RE, both with and without the VM. These findings reinforce the safety of RE in healthy pregnancy.

Male Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: sedentary+Sham, sedentary+ myocardial infarction, aerobic trained + myocardial infarction, and resistance trained + myocardial infarction. Sham and myocardial infarction were performed after training periods. In the days following the surgeries, evaluations were performed. Aerobic training prevents aerobic (to a greater extent) and resistance capacity impairments, ventricular dysfunction, baroreflex sensitivity and autonomic disorders (vagal tonus decrease and sympathetic tonus increase) triggered by myocardial infarction. Resistance training was able to prevent negative changes to aerobic and resistance capacity (to a greater extent) but not to ventricular dysfunction, and it prevented cardiovascular sympathetic increments. Additionally, both types of training reduced left ventricle inflammatory cytokine concentration. Our results suggest that aerobic and, for the first time, dynamic resistance training were able to reduce sympathetic tonus to the heart and vessels, as well as preventing the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the left ventricle of trained groups. These data emphasizes the positive effects of aerobic and dynamic resistance training on the prevention of the negative changes triggered by myocardial infarction.

Although several kettlebell multimovement protocols have been analyzed, little research has attempted to quantify the aerobic stimulus of the individual events in GS, which could better inform kettlebell-related exercise prescription. The purpose of this study was to quantify the cardiopulmonary demand, assessed primarily by oxygen consumption (V̇o2) and heart rate (HR), of continuous high-intensity kettlebell snatches—under conditions relevant to GS—and to compare this demand with a more traditional graded rowing ergometer maximal exercise test. Ten male participants (age = 28.4 ± 4.6 years, height = 185 ± 7 cm, body mass = 95.1 ± 14.9 kg) completed (a) a graded-exercise test on a rowing ergometer to determine maximal oxygen consumption (V̇o2max) and maximal heart rate (HRmax) and (b) a graded-exercise test consisting of continuous 16-kg kettlebell snatches to determine peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2peak) and peak heart rate (HRpeak) during a simulated GS snatch event. Subjects achieved a V̇o2max of 45.7 ± 6.7 ml·kg−1·min−1 and HRmax of 177 ± 8.3 b·min–1 on the rowing ergometer. The kettlebell snatch test produced a V̇o2peak of 37.6 ± 4.4 ml·kg−1·min−1 (82.7 ± 6.5% V̇o2max) and a HRpeak of 174 ± 10 b·min–1 (98.0 ± 3.4% HRmax). These findings suggest that GS kettlebell snatches with 16-kg can provide an adequate aerobic stimulus to improve cardiorespiratory fitness in those with a V̇o2max of ≤51 ml·kg−1·min−1, according to aerobic training recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine.

Dance is characterized as an intermittent type of exercise, demanding energy from different metabolic pathways (aerobic and anaerobic, lactic or alactic). A dancer's maximum aerobic capacity (ranging from 37 to 57 ml·kg-1·min-1) is related to his or her dance style, gender, level of technical ability, and status in a dance company. However, dancers' cardiorespiratory requirements during dance classes (essentially designed for the development of technical skills) are significantly lower than during dance performances, indicating that there is a divergence between dance training and performance with regard to demands on dancers' physical fitness. It follows that supplementary fitness training is needed in order to optimize dancers' technical and artistic performance and to reduce the incidence of injury. Traditional aerobic and strength training have been proposed to cover dancers' lack of conditioning; however, it seems likely that high-intensity interval training would more properly meet the requirements of today's choreography. Therefore, with an approach that applies basic exercise physiology to dance characteristics, this review covers the following topics: 1. dance as physical exercise; 2. dancers' aerobic capacity; 3. cardiorespiratory demands of dance classes and performances; 4. supplementary fitness training for dancers; and 5. fitness testing and assessment for dancers.

Hydrotherapy is popular with patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Its efficacy as an aerobic conditioning aid is equivocal. Patients with RA have reduced muscle strength and may be unable to achieve a walking speed commensurate with an aerobic training effect because the resistance to movement increases with speed in water. The physiological effects of immersion may alter the heart rate--oxygen consumption relationship (HR--VO2) with the effect of rendering land-based exercise prescriptions inaccurate. The primary purpose of the present study was to compare the relationships between heart rate (HR), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), with speed during land and water treadmill walking in patients with RA. Method. The study design used a two-factor within-subjects model. Fifteen females with RA (47±8 SD years) completed three consecutive bouts of walking for five minutes at 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 km/h-1 on land and water treadmills. Expired gas, collected via open-circuit spirometry, HR and RPE were measured. Results. HR and RPE increased on land and in water as speed increased. Below 3.5 km/h-1 VO2 was significantly lower in water than on land (p<0.01). HR was lower (p <0.001), unchanged and higher (p&lt:0.001) at 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 km/h-1 in water than on land. RPE was significantly higher in water than on land (p<0.05). VO2 was approximately 60% of the predicted VO2 max during the fast walking speed in water. For a given VO2, HR was approximately nine beats/min-1 and RPE 1--2 points on the 6--20 Borg scale, higher in water than on land. Conclusions. The study showed that the metabolic demand of walking at 4.5 km/h-1 was sufficient to stimulate an increase in aerobic capacity. The use of land-based prescriptive norms would underestimate the metabolic cost in water. Therefore, in water HR should be increased by...

The purpose of this article is to review the relationship between physical inactivity and age-associated changes to the cardiovascular system, and provide guidance on prescribing exercise to healthy older persons in order to mitigate the adverse effects of cardiovascular aging. DESIGN:: Interpretive review of the literature. RESULTS:: A number of structural and functional changes occur in the cardiovascular system with advancing age, many of which are mediated by changes in vascular stiffness. These changes lead not only to cardiovascular events and strokes, but also to frailty, functional decline, and cognitive impairment. A substantial proportion of the decline in aerobic capacity with age may result from physical inactivity. Guidelines for the prescription of aerobic, resistance, and balance training for otherwise healthy older persons are provided. CONCLUSIONS:: Lack of physical activity is a major risk factor for the epidemic of chronic disease and disability facing an aging population. Many age-associated changes in cardiovascular function result from physical inactivity. The benefits of regular exercise include prevention of cardiovascular events, disability, and cognitive impairment. Age is not a contraindication to exercise, which can usually be initiated safely in older persons.

Subjects in both the endurance training (E) and endurance and strength (E & S) groups trained 3 days a week, for 12 weeks, at an intensity of 70–80% VO2 peak for 30 min on a cycle ergometer. Subjects in the E & S groups also used resistance equipment to train the knee extensors. The workload for resistance training was based on an initial assessment of 10 repetitions maximum (10 RM), with 80% of that value used for training, three times weekly. Peak oxygen consumption increased to an average of 24.8 and 29.9% in the E and E & S groups, respectively, with no difference between groups. Subjects in the E & S and E groups significantly increased sub-maximal endurance time by 396 and 165%, respectively. Cardiac output, stroke volume, and arteriovenous oxygen difference at 80% peak VO2 were unchanged by either of the training methods. A needle biopsy was taken from the vastus lateralis before and after 12 weeks of training. Chi-square analysis of fibre area data showed an increase in the frequency of larger type I fibres in the post-training data from the E & S group, but an increase in the frequency of smaller fibres in the E group post-training; however, mean fibre area was not significantly changed by training. These data suggest that greater improvements in sub-maximal time to fatigue and strength is achieved when resistance training is added to an aerobic training programme in healthy elderly women.

Objective: To verify chronic cardiovascular and muscle strength adaptations in hypertensive women who underwent 12 weeks of concurrent training (CT) in different orders. Methods: Twenty hypertensive women were randomly assigned into 2 groups: resistance exercise-endurance group (REE; 56.00 ± 5.20 years; 78.95 ± 8.28 kg; 155.10 ± 5.30 cm; 33.00 ± 5.30 kg.m-2) and endurance-resistance exercise group (ERE; 57.10 ± 13.38 years; 76.56 ± 18.87 kg; 155.50 ± 8.18 cm; 31.41 ± 5.84 kg.m-2). The endurance exercise was composed of 3 sets of 4 exercises, with 8-RM loads with a 90-second break between sets and exercises. The resistance exercise lasted for 25 minutes and was of progressive intensity. Muscle strength (8-RM), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and double product were assessed pre- and post-exercise. Results: The ANOVA showed significant increases in strength for all exercises (p <0.0001) regardless of the order of the concurrent training (bench press, p = 0.680; leg press, p = 0.244; seated row, p = 0.668; and leg extension, p = 0.257). No significant differences in systolic (p = 0.074) and diastolic blood pressures (p = 0.064) were observed for different CT conditions. However, significant reductions in systolic (p = 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressures (p = 0.006) and double product (p = 0.006) only occurred in the REE group. Conclusion: Endurance training and resistance exercise promote significant muscle strength gains after 12 weeks of training regardless of CT order in hypertensive women. Beneficial cardiovascular responses (SBP, DBP, and RPP) were also observed when endurance training was initiated. Level of evidence I; Therapeutic Studies - Investigating Treatment Outcomes.

It is known that adult females have better cardiovascular health than males until a certain stage of life, yet limited research has examined gender differences in vascular function. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate vascular structure and function, blood pressure, and blood glucose/cholesterol levels in relation to gender differences in young healthy adults. On three separate days, 44 adults (26.30 ±11.9yrs; 24M, 20F) completed a carotid IMT ultrasound, a flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a fasted glucose and cholesterol test, a 24hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, a VO2max test, and a body composition measurement. Females had lower systolic blood pressure, lower diastolic blood pressure, lower LDL/HDL ratios, lower body mass index, a higher HDL count, and lower plasma glucose levels than males (p < 0.05 for all), all of which suggest better cardiovascular health. However, we found no gender differences in vascular health measures, IMT and FMD. Our results suggest that while young adult females have better cardiovascular health than males, endothelial function may not yet be affected in the young adult years.

Twenty-four and 15 athletes, respectively, performed a set of 10 repetitions in both the bench throw (BT P60) and jump squat exercise (JS P60) with a resistance of 60 kg. For both exercises, power output was highest on either the second (JS P60) or the third repetition (BT P60) and was then maintained until the fifth repetition. Significant declines in power output occurred from the sixth repetition onwards until the 10th repetition (11.2% for BT P60 and 5% for JS P60 by the 10th repetition). These findings suggest that athletes attempting to increase maximal power limit their repetitions to 2 to 5 when using resistances of 35 to 45% 1RM in these exercises.

Current studies on agility are focused on COD ability. COD ability refers to the ability to change direction quickly with the knowledge of the route, and is demonstrated to be one crucial determinants of soccer performance. This review summarized the studies on COD ability in soccer from three aspects: test methods, influencing factors and training strategies. The results show that there are a variety of test methods for assessing the COD ability, with Illinois, T, 505, and Zigzag as the most commonly used in current literature, while the methods are of fluctuating reliability and limited validity. It is indicated that low-limb muscle strength, straight-line sprint ability, balance ability, aerobic ability, asymmetry of low-limb, age, technique, play position and test field are influencing factors to COD ability. Regarding the training strategies for developing the COD ability, dynamic stretching, specific load half-squat (dynamic) or intermittent half-squat (static) during warm-up period are among the acute ones, and plyometric, resistance, straight sprint, balance, COD, combined training are among the chronic ones. Researches on COD ability in soccer are warranted with the involvement of perception and decision-making factors in order to explore the agility of soccer players.

The participants were divided into tertiles based on percentage of changes in HDL-c concentrations after combined training. Only women in the upper tertile (positive responders: Δ > 10.4%; n = 19) and lower tertile (negative responders: Δ < −1.4%; n = 19) were considered for analyses. The total body fat (BF), trunk fat (TF), android fat (AF), gynoid fat, and lean body mass were estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The metabolic profile - glucose, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, HDL-c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) - were assessed. After 16 weeks, both positive and negative responders presented similar improvement in body composition, such as a decrease in percentage and kilograms of BF, TF, and AF, and increase in lean body mass ( p value for time < 0.05). As expected, there was an effect of time and also a significant interaction (time vs. group) ( p value < 0.001) in the improvement of HDL-c, with higher values for positive responders. Regarding metabolic profile, there were significant interactions (time vs. group) for triacylglycerol ( p value = 0.032) and VLDL ( p value = 0.027) concentrations, with lower values for positive responders. Our results suggests there is heterogeneity in combined training-induced HDL-c changes in postmenopausal women, and the positive responders were those who presented more pronounced decreases in triacylglycerol and VLDL concentrations.

Eight males with a long history of resistance training performed isokinetic, isometric and isotonic leg extension strength tests 8 and 32 h after 50 min of cycle ergometry at 70-110% of critical power. The participants also completed a control condition in which no cycling was performed. Plasma lactate and ammonia were measured before and immediately after each strength test. Isokinetic, isometric and isotonic leg extension torques were not significantly different 8 or 32 h after endurance exercise compared with the control condition (P > 0.05). A large (50.3%), but not statistically significant, increase in plasma ammonia was evident during the strength tests performed 8 h after endurance exercise, while a significant (P < 0.05) increase in ammonia was also seen 32 h after endurance exercise. No significant changes in plasma ammonia were evident in the control condition. Our results suggest that leg extension strength was not compromised by an earlier bout of endurance cycling. However, metabolic activity during the strength tests might have been altered by the preceding bout of endurance exercise.

Twenty-four university students were randomly allocated to one of two training groups (combined uphill-downhill and horizontal) and a control group. The combined training method produced significant improvements in maximal isometric force (7.1%) and rate of force production (≈25%) of the knee flexor muscles (p<0.05). The combined training was also significantly more effective in improving the maximum sprinting speed (5.9%, p<0.05) and associated kinematic variables. In particular, the propulsive phase of contact decreased significantly by 17% (p<0.05) indicating a link between the improved rate of force production during the isometric test and the rate of production of propulsive forces during sprinting. The increased capacity of the leg flexor muscles to generate force appears to contribute to the improvement of sprinting speed perhaps due to a more efficient muscle function during the support phase of the stride.

Specific explosive type strength training (1-2 sessions per week) was utilized throughout the season. The present findings showed that the entire competitive season led to no systematic changes in the maximum oxygen uptake (from 48.0 plus/minus 6.6 to 47.0 plus/minus ml.kg-1.min-1), in anthropometric characteristics or in maximal isometric force of the leg extensor muscles (from 2567 plus/minus 490 to 2622 plus/minus 747 N). However, significant increases occurred during the season both in the average power output during the first 15 s work in an anaerobic jumping test and in the maximal vertical jumping heights in the squat jump (from 21.7 plus/minus 2.3 to 24.2 plus/minus 2.4 cm) and in the counter movement jump (from 24.9 plus/minus 2.6 to 26.3 plus/minus 2.9 cm). A considerable change occurred also in the shape of the isometric force-time curve of the leg extensor muscles so that the times to produce submaximal force level shortened. The individual changes during the competitive season both in the power output and in the times of rapid force production correlated negatively with the individual initial values recorded before the season. The present findings suggest that the prolonged competitive season in the present female basketball players seemingly placed sufficient demands on the athletes in energy production through aerobic processes to maintain their level of VO2max. The increases observed in explosive performance characteristics may in part be explained by the low initial level recorded before the season. On the other hand, the explosive type strength training utilized may have helped to overcome possible interfering effects of the overall volume of the training and competitive aerobic demands over the competitive season.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH320393&site=ehost-live"

The aim of this paper was to systematically review the literature assessing changes in salivary markers in basketball following long-term and short-term training periods. An electronic database search of articles published until October 2020 was completed in PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and Web of Science. Studies were then screened and selected using predefined selection criteria with 1080 articles identified. After removing 690 duplicates, 390 articles were included for screening, which revealed 15 articles that met the inclusion criteria. The main findings revealed no changes in testosterone (T), cortisol (C) or their ratio (T:C), while contrasting results were found in immunoglobulin A (IgA) and total protein (TP) levels across long-term periodized training periods in different basketball populations. The analysis of short-term training periods showed that strength-hypertrophy training induced higher C levels compared to a non-exercising day, one-power training and one-endurance training session in female basketball players, while no changes were evident for T and IgA. Moreover, the analysis of salivary markers in response to small-sided games (SSGs) documented a large-to-moderate increase in alpha-amylase (AA) from pre- to post-SSG and inconsistent results of C and T across differently designed SSGs. The current results provide a detailed description of salivary marker changes in response to different basketball long- and short-term training periods, which can help practitioners in designing sound training programmes to optimize players' fitness and health status across different phases of the season.

Methods: Nineteen field players from a team in the U-19 Spanish first division participated in the study. Changes in jump ability (CMJ, CMJL), bar movement speed in a loaded full squat (FSL), sprint time over 30m (T10, T20, T30, T10-20, T10-30, T20-30), and maximal aerobic speed (MAS) were evaluated three times (E1, E2, E3) during the fourth months studied. Players' HR during practices and matches were recorded. Improvements in MAS, application of strength in CMJ, CMJL, and FSL were reported, while the players significantly worsening their sprint times. Results: No significant relationships were found between HR values and changes in players' physical conditioning. Changes in sprint times (T30 and T10-30) were correlated with changes in bar speed for the FS60kg (r = 0.53-0.64, p < 0.05) and volume of strength training performed (r = 0.53-0.59, p < 0.05). These improvements in strength did not induce expected improvement in sprint time, possibly due to the interference effect between concurrent aerobic and strength training. Conclusions: The results suggests that improved ability to accelerate could be related to improvements in loaded full squats moving at speed near 1m.s-1, and the inhibitor effect obtained shows the importance of monitoring the intensity of aerobic training.

Characterizing the tapering practices of United States and Canadian raw powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 35(12S): S26–S35, 2021—The purpose of this study was to characterize the tapering practices used by North American powerlifters. A total of 364 powerlifters completed a 41-item survey encompassing demographics, general training, general tapering, and specific tapering practices. Nonparametric statistics were used to assess sex (male and female), competition level (regional/provincial, national, and international), and competition lift (squat, bench press, and deadlift). The highest training volume most frequently took place 5–8 weeks before competition, whereas the highest training intensity was completed 2 weeks before competition. A step taper was primarily used over 7–10 days while decreasing the training volume by 41–50% with varied intensity. The final heavy (>85% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) back squat and deadlift sessions were completed 7–10 days before competition, whereas the final heavy bench press session was completed <7 days before competition. Final heavy lifts were completed at 90.0–92.5% 1RM but reduced to 75–80% 1RM for back squat and bench press and 70–75% for deadlift during the final training session of each lift. Set and repetition schemes during the taper varied between lifts with most frequent reports of 3 × 2, 3 × 3, and 3 × 1 for back squat, bench press, and deadlift, respectively. Training cessation durations before competition varied between deadlift (5.8 ± 2.5 days), back squat (4.1 ± 1.9 days), and bench press (3.9 ± 1.8 days). Complete training cessation was implemented 2.8 ± 1.1 days before competition and varied between sex and competition level. These findings provide novel insights into the tapering practices of North American powerlifters and can be used to inform powerlifting coaches and athlete's tapering decisions.

We examined 32 older males 60-74 years of age and grouped as sedentary (CON, n = 11), chronic endurance trained (ET, n = 10), and chronic endurance trained + resistance training (ET + RT, n = 11). Exercise history was obtained by questionnaire. Absolute strength and power measures were obtained by the one-repetition maximum method. Relative strength and power were determined by dividing the absolute measure by the muscle mass involved in the exercise. Total and regional muscle mass was measured by DXA. Absolute and relative leg power were not significantly different among the 3 groups. In contrast, absolute leg press strength was greater in ET + RT compared with CON, and relative leg press strength was greater in ET and ET + RT compared with CON. Chronic running combined with resistance training may therefore enhance absolute and relative muscle strength in older adults, but does not influence muscle power. Endurance exercise may inhibit the ability of resistance exercise to positively influence skeletal muscle power.

A sample of 30 subjects with an average age of 50 years (with type 2 diabetes mellitus) has been recruited in random mode. Subjects did a circuit training workout for eight weeks with a frequency of 3 weekly sessions of 40 minutes each for a total of 120 minutes per week. The 6-minute walking test was administered in and out. The T-test for dependent samples was used to detect the difference between the two groups (p < .05). The circuit training program has led to an increase in the level of cardiorespiratory form. The average VO2max increased significantly (p < .05) compared to the basic values, with an increase of +6.08%. The circuit training carried out for 8 weeks, lasting 40 minutes with intensity between 50 and 75% of the VO2max, is able to achieve appreciable improvements on cardiorespiratory fitness.

Objective: To compare the effects of aerobic training and CWT upon morphological and functional cardiac adaptations detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Methods: Twenty healthy sedentary individuals were randomly assigned to participate in a 12-week programme of aerobic training (n = 6), CWR (n = 7) or no intervention (n = 7, controls). Training programmes consisted of 36 sessions, 35 mm each, 3 times per week, at 70% of maximal heart rate, and CWT included series of resistance exercises performed at 60% of 1 maximal repetition. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were performed before and after the intervention. Results: There was a similar improvement in VO2PEAK following aerobic training (mean (SD) increment: 12 (4)%) and CWT (12 (4)%), while there was no change in the control group. Aerobic training (12 (6)%) and CWT (16 (5)%) improved strength in the lower limbs, and only CWT resulted in improvement of 13 (4)% in the strength of the upper limbs. However, there were no detectable changes in left ventricular mass, end-diastolic volume, stroke volume or ejection fraction. Conclusion: In previously sedentary individuals, short-term CWT and aerobic training induce similar improvement in functional capacity without any adaptation in cardiac morphology detectable by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

Thirty-five sedentary postmenopausal women with obesity were randomly divided into endurance training (EN1, N = 10), concurrent training (CON, N = 13) or no training group (CT, N = 12). Additionally, twelve sedentary premenopausal women with obesity were added to an endurance training group (EN2, N = 12). Participants took part in a 12-week supervised intervention, performing 3 sessions/week of 60 min/session. Before and after the interventions, body composition and fitness were assessed, and blood samples obtained to measure serum myokines levels. Total fat mass decreased in all exercised groups (CON,−5.2%; EN1,−5.3%; EN2,−5.6%). In postmenopausal women, serum IL-6, IL-15 and IL-15Ra decreased after training (P<0.01), finding a pronounced reduction in IL-6 (−42% vs. −16%) and IL-15 (−50% vs. −31%) when comparing EN1 to CON (P<0.05). Serum FGF21 was only reduced in the EN1 (−27%; P=0.012). While EN1 and EN2 comparison, reported differences for IL-15Rα concentration (−28% vs. −40%; P=0.023). Finally, in EN2, the delta change of fat mass and IL-6, IL-15 and IL-15Rα were associated (r = 0.605; r = 0.546; r = 0.515; P<0.05). IL-13 showed undetected concentrations. Circulating IL-6, IL-15 and FGF21 response to training is altered by exercise type but not by menopause in women with obesity. Endurance training promotes a higher reduction of these myokines, potentially activating their intricate immune and fat mass regulation roles in postmenopausal women with obesity.

However, the effects of combined resistance and aerobic exercise program on VP and CP, especially in type 2 diabetes patients, have not been adequately investigated. Thus, this new parameter can be useful to prescribe exercise programs more assertive for this population. The present study aimed to assess the effect of 3 months of combined resistance and aerobic exercise training (CET) on CP and VP in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 48 diabetic patients with an average age of 52.4 (±8.01) years old. The subjects were randomized into two groups: sedentary (SG, n = 15) and the CET group (n = 19). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (symptom‐limited incremental) was performed on a cycle ergometer, and the following parameters were measured: relative VO2, VE/VCO2 slope, linear relationship between oxygen uptake and minute ventilation, and VCO2. CET was performed with 30‐min aerobic and 30‐min resistance exercises three times a week for 12 weeks. Results: Significant (p <.05) and clinical (d ≥.80) differences were observed that favoured CET compared with SG for the following variables: heart rate, workload, VO2 relative peak, circulatory power peak, and VCO2 peak. Although no statistical difference was observed for ventilatory power, there was a clinical difference (p >.05 and d ≥ 0.80) that favoured CET. Conclusion: Three months of combined exercise training improved VP and CP indices in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with a sedentary group.

"Clinical Outcomes of Isotonic Resistance Training for a Female with Stable Chronic Heart Failure.","Palevo, G; Nicks, C","Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research",="10648011",,="20110302","25",,"S64","2","113578753",,,"Abstract",,,"Background: Chronic heart failure (HF) is characterized by ventricular dysfunction and reduced exercise tolerance. Aerobic exercise has traditionally been used as the exercise mode in rehabilitation programs. However, recent studies have demonstrated that dynamic resistance training (RT) can be an effective component of a treatment program for patients with HF. More studies are needed to determine the protocols and the overall effectiveness of RT for HF patients. In addition, there is a paucity of data relating to the impact of RT in female HF patients. PURPOSE: The purpose of this case study is to report results of a clinical trial investigating the effects of isotonic RT in a female HF patient while controlling for aerobic exercise. METHODS: Prior to training, physical fitness (6-minute walk & upper/lower 1-RM), left ventricular function (using 3D cardiac echocardiography), and self-reported perceived health (Duke Health Profile and Minnesota Living with HF questionnaire) were assessed on a female classified with stage II HF. After baseline testing, the participant (age = 54 yrs; weight = 64.8 kg; height = 170.2 cm) completed an 8-week isotonic RT program consisting of 12 exercises (intensity of ∼60% 1RM), 3 days per weeks. To better determine the specific role of RT for HF patients, the participant avoided concurrent aerobic exercise training throughout the 8-week intervention while medication and normal ADL's remained unchanged. RESULTS: Following the 8-week training intervention, there was an overall improvement observed in physical fitness for the patient. Six-minute walk distance increased 34 meters (5.9%) while upper and lower 1RM improved 40% (15 kg to 21 kg) and 11% (54 kg to 60 kg), respectively. With respect to left ventricular function, a 32% increase in ejection fraction was observed along with a 2.6% increase in stroke volume. Left ventricular end systolic volume decreased by 42 mL (135 to 92.6 mL). In addition, the patient reported improvements in physical and mental health, self esteem, and anxiety-depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a short-term structured isotonic RT program improved physical fitness and certain variables related to perceived health status in this female HF patient. Left-ventricular function did not worsen, but improved following the training. Practical Applications: Implementing a safe, structured, isotonic RT program appears to be an effective mode of exercise to add to the rehabilitation HF patients. This case study reveals that this RT may also benefit female HF patients, a population less reported in existing literature.

Forty PLWH (20 men and 20 women) were randomized into RT+AT group (n = 20; age = 38.3 ± 4.9) or non‐exercise control group (n = 20; age = 37.9 ± 5.1). The RT+AT group was required to perform a nonlinear periodized resistance training program targeting large muscle groups followed by 20 min aerobic exercise at 65‐80% of maximal heart rate. Participants in RT+AT performed three supervised sessions per week for 6‐months, whereas participants in the control group were instructed to continue with their current lifestyle habits. The primary outcome was bone mineral density (lumbar spine (L2‐L4), femoral neck, and distal 1/3 radius). Secondary outcomes included physical function, anthropometry, inflammatory markers, and growth factors. The RT+AT group demonstrated a significant increase in BMD at follow‐up for the Lumbar spine (L2‐L4), femoral neck, and 1/3 radius (all, P <.05), and There were no gender differences in the training response between men and women for any of the BMD regions. Similar findings were also observed for lean body mass, IGF1and Adiponectin (P <.001). We observed a decrease in percent body fat, fat mass, IL‐6, TNF‐α, and myostatin in the RT+AT group (P <.001). Finally, there was a significant increase in handgrip strength and gait speed for both women and men in the RT+AT group (P <.001). A combination of resistance and aerobic training appears to be a feasible and effective means for counteracting bone loss and improving various inflammatory markers, physical function, and growth hormones in PLWH.

However, how aerobic exercise performed before or after a bout of RT affects vascular function is unknown. The present study investigates the effect of aerobic exercise before and after RT on vascular function. Thirty-three young, healthy subjects were randomly assigned to groups that ran before RT (BRT: 4 male, 7 female), ran after RT (ART: 4 male, 7 female), or remained sedentary (SED: 3 male, 8 female). The BRT and ART groups performed RT at 80% of one repetition maximum and ran at 60% of the targeted heart rate twice each week for 8 wk. Both brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) after combined training in the BRT group did not change from baseline. In contrast, baPWV after combined training in the ART group reduced from baseline (from 1,025 ± 43 to 910 ± 33 cm/s, P < 0.01). Moreover, brachial artery FMD after combined training in the ART group increased from baseline (from 7.3 ± 0.8 to 9.6 ± 0.8%, P < 0.01). Brachial artery diameter, mean blood velocity, and blood flow in the BRT and ART groups after combined training increased from baseline (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001, respectively). These values returned to the baseline during the detraining period. These values did not change in the SED group. These results suggest that although vascular function is not improved by aerobic exercise before RT, performing aerobic exercise thereafter can prevent the deteriorating of vascular function.

Physically active, healthy young men were randomly divided into three groups that performed: aerobic and resistance training consecutively in the same training session (SS) 2‐3 days wk−1 or on alternating days (AD) 4‐6 days wk−1 as well as control (C). The total training volume was matched in the training groups. The control group was asked to maintain their habitual physical activity and exercise level. Maximal leg press strength (1RM) and peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) were measured. Abdominal fat mass was estimated with dual‐energy absorptiometry (DXA). High‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP‐1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α), and adipocytokines resistin, adiponectin, and leptin were analyzed from plasma samples. Training significantly reduced circulating hs‐CRP, leptin, and resistin in both training groups (<italic>P</italic><.05), whereas MCP‐1 and TNF‐α decreased only in AD (<italic>P</italic><.05). Significant correlations were observed between changes in abdominal fat mass and corresponding changes in MCP‐1, leptin, adiponectin, and resistin. Long‐term combined aerobic and resistance training reduced markers of subclinical inflammation in healthy young men. The results indicate that a higher frequency of individual exercise sessions might be more beneficial with respect to the anti‐inflammatory effects of physical activity. The decreases in inflammation markers seem to be related to decreases in abdominal fat mass.

This is commonly caused by a poor lifestyle, which may lead to an increased risk of non-communicable diseases. Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine if a six-week concurrent resistance and aerobic training program could elicit body composition and cardiorespiratory changes in rural black college women. Methods: Forty sedentary black females (aged 18 - 25 years) were randomly assigned to a combined resistance and aerobic training (COM) group (n = 20) or a control group (n = 20). The COM group participated in four times weekly aerobic and resistance training. Aerobic training consisted of 30 minutes a session (week 1 - 3: cycling for 3 minutes at 60% heart rate reserve (HRR), followed by 2 minutes at 50% HRR; week 4 - 6: 3 minutes at 70% HRR, followed by 2 minutes at 60% HRR). Resistance training consisted of participants training at 50% of their one-repetition maximum (1-RM) for week 1 - 3, doing 3 sets of 15 repetitions; for week 4 - 6 at 60% 1-RM, doing 3 sets of 15 repetitions. Results: Following the intervention, the COM group significantly (P ≤ 0.05) decreased their body fat percentage when compared to the control group (P = 0.006; d = 0.9), while no significant changes were observed in waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.223) and cardiorespiratory endurance (P = 0.260) in either group. Conclusions: Although body composition (especially waist circumference and body fat percentage) and cardiorespiratory fitness are recommended as the main targets of physical activity programs aimed at preventing CVD in college students, this study demonstrated that a six-week concurrent program improved body fat percentage, and not WHR and cardiorespiratory fitness, in sedentary rural college-aged females. Further, these findings suggest that one method of program design does not fit all populations and that exercise prescription should be targeted and not generalized.

Methods: Seventy-two women, 60-74 yr old, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1 d•wk-1 of aerobic training and 1 d•wk-1 of resistance training (1 + 1), 2 d•wk-1 of aerobic training and 2 d•wk-1 resistance training (2 + 2), or 3 d•wk-1 of aerobic training and 3 d•wk-1 of resistance training (3 + 3). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), feeling of fatigue, depression, and vigor (questionnaire), strength (one-repetition maximum), serum cytokines (enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay), maximal oxygen uptake (progressive treadmill test), resting energy expenditure, and TEE were measured before and after 16 wk of training. Aerobic training consisted of 40 min of aerobic exercise at 80% maximum heart rate, and resistance training consisted of two sets of 10 repetitions for 10 different exercises at 80% of one repetition maximum. Results: All groups increased fat-free mass, strength, and aerobic fitness and decreased fat mass. No changes were observed in cytokines or perceptions of fatigue/depression. No time-group interaction was found for any fitness/body composition variable. TEE and AEE increased with the 2 + 2 group but not with the other two groups. Nonexercise training AEE (nonexercise training activity-related thermogenesis) increased significantly in the 2 + 2 group (+200 kcal•d-1), group 1 + 1 showed atrend for an increase (+68 kcal•d-1), and group 3 + 3 decreased significantly (-150 kcal•d-1). Conclusion: Results indicate that 3 + 3 training may inhibit nonexercise training activity- related thermogenesis by being too time consuming and does not induce superior training adaptations to 1 + 1 and 2 + 2 training.

Major electronic databases were searched, from inception to November 2020, for randomized clinical trials comparing the effects of CT against AT or control on VO2 peak and/or quadriceps muscle strength in patients with HF. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted, calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD). Twenty-eight articles were included. An increase on VO2 peak (SMD = 0.77, 95%CI 0.39–1.14, I2=80.1%) and quadriceps muscle strength (SMD = 0.67, 95%CI 0.18–1.16, I2=0%) was found in CT compared to control. CT increased quadriceps muscle strength, versus AT (SMD = 0.44, 95%CI 0.15–0.74, I2=0%). There were no differences between CT and AT on VO2 peak (SMD=–0.01, 95%CI –0.36 to 0.34, I2=65%). Time of session and training duration moderate the effects of CT over control on VO2 peak. CT promotes increases on quadriceps muscle strength and aerobic capacity over control and provides additional gains on quadriceps muscle strength, having the same effects on VO2 peak compared to AT. A longer time of session is associated with greater benefits to aerobic capacity. Combining aerobic and strength training increases the functional capacity and quadriceps muscle strength in heart failure patients. Using longer sessions of training has a greater impact on aerobic capacity. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=158506311&site=ehost-live"

Materials and Methods: The study was carried out as two training sessions in a week, for eight weeks duration. The total number of participants was 90 male and 90 female collegiate volleyball players aged 18-22 years. All the participants were recreational players and they were playing one hour daily in the evening. They were randomly distributed into three male groups (Group 1, Group 2 & Group 3) and three female groups (Group 4, Group 5 & Group 6) with 30 participants in each group. All the participants underwent Sargent vertical jump performance test before starting the training session it was repeated in every two weeks of training program. Results: Plyometrics and plyometrics with dynamic stretching led to significant improvements in vertical jump height (VJH), and this improvement was progressed after every two weeks of training. However, the control groups did not display any improvement. The effect of training was significantly higher in male and female groups who have performed plyometrics with lower limbs dynamic stretching as compared with the groups that performed only plyometric exercises (p<0.05). Compared to females, male participants had a better improvement of VJH in both training groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: It can be concluded that two sessions of plyometric exercise training per week for eight weeks can improve the ability of VJH in male and female collegiate volleyball players. However, combined training of lower body plyometrics and lower limbs dynamic stretching had better results in terms of vertical jump performance.

Thus, the purpose of this report was to monitor the adaptations of a combined strength, performed by circuit resistance training (CRT), and endurance programme in two top level female race walkers. The subjects were examined before and after 12 weeks of CRT and endurance training and performed an incremental field test to determine maximum oxygen uptake (.VO2max), running economy (RE) and lactate threshold (LT). The results showed that 12 weeks of combined CRT and endurance programme did not correspond to an alteration in.VO2max and RE, while improvements in LT and 5-km performance were seen.

Introduction: Cancer cachexia is characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. Increased protein catabolism, inflammation, impaired anabolism, and mitochondrial function markedly contribute to the pathogenesis of this syndrome. Physical activity has been suggested as a useful tool to prevent or at least delay the onset and progression of cancer-induced muscle wasting. Two main types of exercise can be adopted, namely, resistance and endurance training. The present study is aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a combined (resistance + endurance) exercise protocol in preventing/reverting cancer-induced muscle wasting. Methods: Mice bearing the C26 colon carcinoma have been used as a model of cancer cachexia. They have been exposed to combined exercise training during 6 wk (4 before tumor implantation, 2 during tumor growth). Climbing a 1-m ladder inclined at 85° has been used for resistance training, while aerobic (endurance) exercise has been carried out on the same day using a motorized wheel. Results: In C26-bearing mice, both muscle mass and strength are improved by combined training, while just the latter increased in exercised healthy animals. Such a pattern is associated with modulations of two markers of autophagy, namely, LC3B-I/II ratio, increased in sedentary tumor hosts and reduced in exercised C26-bearing mice, and p62, steadily increased in both sedentary and trained tumor-bearing animals. Finally, combined training is not able to modify PGC-1α protein levels, but it improves succinate dehydrogenase activity, both reduced in the muscle of the C26 hosts. Conclusion: The data reported in the present study show that combined training improves muscle mass and function in the C26 hosts, likely modulating autophagy and improving mitochondrial function; these observations suggest that combined exercise might become part of a multimodal approach to treat cancer cachexia.

This study evaluated quality of life outcomes following 8-weeks of combined high intensity strength and aerobic training for 18 males (age=67.0 12.5 yrs; ejection fraction=27.5 6.8) with congestive heart failure (CHF). Subjects performed 30 min of aerobic exercise three days per week and high intensity (80% of 1RM) strength training 2 days/week for 8 weeks. The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire was administered before and after training to determine the subjects' self-assessment of the impact CHF has on their lives and perceived benefits of exercise. Significant differences (p<0.05) were found with two of the questionnaire's sub-scales including performance of daily living activities and symptoms related to CHF. Subjects reported that their CHF had less of an impact on their performance of daily living activities and symptoms related to CHF were reduced after training. The changes in quality of life exceeded established criteria (greater than one standard error of the mean) for consideration as clinically relevant changes thus indicating the effectiveness of combined high intensity strength and aerobic training for enhancing quality of life for individuals with CHF.

Ten healthy still active men (73+/-4 years, V(O2) peak: 36 (31-41) ml min-1 kg-1) were tested before and after 14 weeks of combined training (3 times week-1). Training consisted of 3x12 min of high intensity interval training on a bicycle for endurance interspersed by 3x12 min of UB resistance exercises. V(O2) peak during leg cycling and arm cranking, isokinetic torque of knee extensor and shoulder abductor and the cross-sectional area (CSA) of several muscles from UB and LB were measured. Sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and abdominal fat area were measured on MRI scans. Total body composition was assessed by hydrostatic weighing (HW) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Blood lipid profile was assessed before and after training. By the end of the training period, V(O2) peak (l min-1) increased significantly by 9 and 16% in leg cycling and arm cranking tests, respectively. Maximal isokinetic torque increased both for the knee extensor and shoulder abductor muscle groups. CSA increased significantly in deltoid muscle. Percentage of body fat decreased by 1.3% (P<0.05) and abdominal fat and SAD decreased by 12 and 6%, respectively (P<0.01). There was also a significant decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Thus, combined LB endurance and UB resistance training can improve endurance, strength, body composition and blood lipid profile even in healthy active elderly.

Eur J Prev Cardiol 19: 81–94. [Prepared by Mark Elkins, Journal Editor.] Objective: To review the evidence as to whether combined aerobic and resistance training is as effective as aerobic training at improving body composition, fitness, strength and quality of life in people with coronary artery disease. Data sources: Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Embase, Medline, PreMedline, SportDiscus and CINAHL, searched up to October 2009. This search was supplemented by citation tracking. Study selection: Randomised controlled trials involving people with coronary artery disease (including people who had undergone coronary artery surgery or percutaneous intervention) in which aerobic training was compared to combined aerobic and resistance training. Outcome measures were measures of cardiovascular fitness, body composition measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, muscular strength, healthrelated quality of life and self efficacy. Trials involving only patients with heart failure were excluded. Data extraction: Two reviewers determined eligibility and one reviewer extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale and the Jadad scale. Data synthesis: Of 271 studies initially identified by the search, 12 studies with a total of 504 patients met the selection criteria and were included in the review. Study quality ranged from 4 to 8 out of 10 on the PEDro scale, and 2 to 3 out of 5 on the Jadad scale. Based on the quantitative pooling of the available data from these trials, the combined training induced significantly greater improvements than aerobic training on most outcomes. Peak exercise capacity was better by a standardised mean difference of 0.88 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.31), fat free mass improved by 0.9kg more (95% CI 0.4 to 1.4) and percent body fat improved by 2% more (95% CI 1 to 4). Trunk fat and upper and lower limb strength were also significantly better after combined training than after aerobic training. Data for quality of life and self efficacy could not be pooled quantitatively, but all the studies that measured these outcomes reported improvements either in both groups or in the combined training group only. The adverse events noted were typically mild cardiovascular changes or musculoskeletal pain. In subgroup analyses, the study duration and the intensity of the resistance were not associated with an altered treatment effect. Conclusion: Combined aerobic and resistance training is more effective than aerobic training in improving body composition, strength and cardiovascular fitness, probably improving quality of life and self efficacy as well.

Sprint interval training (SIT) performed on a treadmill using level and graded conditions represents a viable alternative to traditional endurance conditioning. To date, little research exists contrasting the effects of these conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation included examining the effects of 2 approaches combining SIT, plyometrics, and strength training on performance measures in soccer players aged 13-18 years over 8 weeks. Forty-six subjects were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 performed SIT using predominantly inclined treadmill conditions combined with resistance and plyometric training (INC, n = 17). Group 2 performed SIT using level treadmill grades and completed the same resistance and plyometric training (LEV, n = 14). Group 3 was a control group representing various sports who continued their normal training (CON, n = 15). Pre- and posttests assessed speed, strength, change of direction, and anaerobic capacity, including sprint speed (9.1 and 18.3 m sprint), unilateral triple hop for distance (3HOP_L and 3HOP_R), pro agility change of direction (PA); treadmill running to exhaustion on a 20% grade (CFMod), and hip flexor maximum strength (HF_1RM). After training, INC and LEV improved more in all measures compared with CON. Furthermore, INC improved significantly more compared with LEV in 9.1- and 18.3-m sprint, 3HOP_L and 3HOP_R, PA, CFMod, and HF_1RM (p < 0.05). We conclude that strength and plyometric training combined with incline-based SIT is more effective than a similar training approach using level-grade SIT.

Methods: This crossover study design included recreationally endurance-trained men and women (age 21-45 y; n = 12 men, 10 women) who performed ES and SE loadings. Force production of the lower extremities including countermovement-jump height (CMJ) and maximal isometric strength (MVC) was measured pre-, mid-, and post-ES and -SE, and ground-reaction forces, ground-reaction times, and running economy were measured during E. Results: A significant decrease in CMJ was observed after combined ES and SE in men (4.5% ± 7.0% and 6.6% ± 7.7%, respectively) but not in women (0.2% ± 8.5% and 1.4% ± 7.3% in ES and SE). MVC decreased significantly in both men (20.7% ± 6.1% ES and 19.3% ± 9.4% SE) and women (12.4% ± 9.3% ES and 11.6% ± 12.0% SE). Stride length decreased significantly in ES and SE men, but not in women. No changes were observed in ground-reaction times during running in men or women. Performing S before E caused greater (P < .01) oxygen uptake during running in both men and women than if E was performed before S, although heart rate and blood lactate were similar between ES and SE. Conclusions: Performing S before E increased oxygen uptake during E, which is explained, in part, by a decrease in MVC in both men and women, decreased CMJ and stride length in men, and/or an increase in postexercise oxygen consumption.

Strength-group performed high-intensity strength training while endurance-group performed cycle training. Combined-group completed both training protocols. Leg extension strength and maximal oxygen uptake were measured. HRQoL was assessed with a Finnish version of SF-36 questionnaire. A significant training induced difference was observed between groups (p = 0.038) in the vitality dimension of HRQoL, which was characterized by a 6.6 ± 1.5 unit increase in the combined group and no change in the other groups. Both endurance and combined training showed small improvements in certain dimensions of HRQoL. Dimensions of general (4.6 ± 1.9) and mental health (3.9 ± 1.4) improved in combined-group while general health (4.4 ± 2.0), bodily pain (5.5 ± 2.5) and role physical (6.0 ± 2.4) improved in endurance-group. Strength-group experienced increased pain (- 5.4 ± 1.8) during the experimental period. However, increased perception of pain was not observed during combined training. According to the present results both endurance and especially combined training may have potential to promote or maintain certain dimensions of HRQoL even in middle-aged and older adults.

The influences between strength and endurance training have been investigated in other sports but the findings are scattered. Some state the interventions are negative to each other, some state there is no negative relationship and some find bisected and supplementary benefits from the combination when training is applied appropriately. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a combined intervention among competitive swimmers. 20 subjects assigned to a training intervention group (n = 11) or a control group (n = 9) from two different teams completed the study. Anthropometrical data, tethered swimming force, land strength, performance in 50 m, 100 m and 400 m, work economy, peak oxygen uptake, stroke length and stroke rate were investigated in all subjects at preand post-test. A combined intervention of maximal strength and high aerobic intensity interval endurance training 2 sessions per week over 11 weeks in addition to regular training were used, while the control group continued regular practice with their respective teams. The intervention group improved land strength, tethered swimming force and 400m freestyle performance more than the control group. The improvement of the 400 m was correlated with the improvement of tethered swimming force in the female part of the intervention group. No change occurred in stroke length, stroke rate, performance in 50 m or 100 m, swimming economy or peak oxygen uptake during swimming. Two weekly dry-land strength training sessions for 11 weeks increase tethered swimming force in competitive swimmers. This increment further improves middle distance swimming performance. 2 weekly sessions of high-intensity interval training does not improve peak oxygen uptake compared with other competitive swimmers.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of aerobic and strength training programmes, performed alone or in combination, on cardiovascular risk factors in sedentary, apparently healthy and non-obese adult men. The study was conducted with 37 subjects who were randomly divided into the following groups: aerobic (AG), combined (ASG), strength (SG) and control (CG). The exercise programmes were performed three times a week and lasted approximately 50 minutes. Dietary intake, anthropometry, blood pressure, muscular strength, aerobic capacity, lipid profile and glycaemic control were assessed before and after 12 weeks of the intervention. One-way analysis of variation (ANOVA) for baseline, and ANOVA for repeated measures were used to assess differences between the initial and final time points of the four groups. Changes in blood pressure and glycaemic control were not significant in any of the groups. No differences were observed in LDL-C between training groups. HDL-C increased significantly only in the AG. In conclusion, if minimal changes in the lipid profile are needed, an aerobic training programme can provide possible benefits for HDL-C in apparently healthy and non-obese adult men.

Is one exercise training modality better than the others for improving these outcomes? Design Systematic review with network meta-analysis of randomised trials. Participants Adults requiring haemodialysis for end-stage renal disease. Intervention Aerobic training, resistance training, combined training and control (no exercise or placebo). Outcome measures Aerobic capacity, arterial blood pressure at rest, and haemodialysis efficiency. Results Thirty-three trials involving 1254 participants were included. Direct meta-analyses were conducted first. Aerobic capacity improved significantly more with aerobic training (3.35 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 1.79 to 4.91) and combined training (5.00 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 3.50 to 6.50) than with control. Only combined training significantly reduced systolic (−9 mmHg, 95% CI −13 to −4) and diastolic (−5 mmHg, 95% CI −6 to −3) blood pressure compared to control. Only aerobic training was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency (Kt/V 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20). However, when network meta-analysis was conducted, there were some important different findings. Both aerobic training and combined training again elicited greater improvements in aerobic capacity than control. For systolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to control. For diastolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to aerobic training and control. No modality was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency. Combined training was ranked as the most effective treatment for aerobic capacity and arterial blood pressure. Conclusion Combined training was the most effective modality to increase aerobic capacity and blood pressure control in people who require haemodialysis. This finding helps to fill the gap created by the lack of head-to-head comparisons of different modalities of exercise in people with end-stage renal disease. Registration PROSPERO CRD42015020531.

Thus, the present study assessed the effects of combined training (CT) on FNDC5/irisin levels, metabolic markers and fitness adaptations in obese men. Middle-age obese men (age 49.13 ± 5.75, body mass index (BMI) 30.86 ± 1.63) were randomly distributed in the CT group (n = 12) and control group (CGn = 10). The CT consisted of strength followed by aerobic training, 3 times/week, for 24 weeks. Body composition, physical fitness, plasma FNDC5/irisin, biochemical markers and metabolic scores/index were evaluated. CT maintained FNDC5/irisin levels (µg/mL) (pre: 4.15 ± 0.32, post: 4.21 ± 0.32;p = .96) and improved body composition, metabolic and physical fitness markers. In the CG, decreased FNDC5/irisin (µg/mL) (pre: 4.36 ± 0.23, post: 3.57 ± 0.94;p = .01) and reduced strength (supine exercise/kg) (pre: 71 ± 14.7, post: 60.1 ± 14.05;p < .01) were observed, along with a trend to increase HOMA-IR (pre: 2.63 ± 1.11, post: 3.14 ± 1.27;p = .07) and other indicators of metabolic deterioration. An inverse correlation was found between the change (Δ%) in levels of FNDC5/irisin and Δ% glucose, Δ% total cholesterol, Δ% triglycerides and Δ% waist circumference, in addition to a positive relation with Δ% muscle strength. In conclusion, CT maintained FNDC5/irisin levels and provided metabolic and fitness benefits. The correlation between FNDC5/irisin changes and metabolic parameters, as well as the FNDC5/irisin reduction associated with fitness and metabolic worsening in the CG, suggests a relationship between FNDC5/irisin and a healthy metabolic status in humans.

A number of studies have systematically investigated how regular cold water immersion influences long-term performance and muscle adaptations. The effects of regular cold water immersion after endurance or high-intensity interval training on aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, power output, and time trial performance are equivocal. Evidence for changes in angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle in response to regular cold water immersion is also mixed. More consistent evidence is available that regular cold water immersion after strength training attenuates gains in muscle mass and strength. These effects are attributable to reduced activation of satellite cells, ribosomal biogenesis, anabolic signaling, and muscle protein synthesis. Athletes use passive heating to warm up before competition or improve postexercise recovery. Emerging evidence indicates that regular exposure to ambient heat, wearing garments perfused with hot water, or microwave diathermy can mimic the effects of endurance training by stimulating angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle. Some passive heating applications may also mitigate muscle atrophy through their effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle fiber hypertrophy. More research is needed to consolidate these findings, however. Future research in this field should focus on 1) the optimal modality, temperature, duration, and frequency of cooling and heating to enhance long-term performance and muscle adaptations and 2) whether molecular and morphological changes in muscle in response to cooling and heating applications translate to improvements in exercise performance.

Objectives: This study aimed to compare the effects of two concurrent training routines, RT+HIIT versus RT+MICT, on CRF and physical fitness in adults and older adults with MetS. Methods: Thirty-nine participants (67.0±6.7 years of age) were randomly assigned into three groups: RT+ MICT, RT+ HIIT and the control group (CON, no exercise). The 12-week physical training program consisted of 3 sessions/week (~50 minutes/session). The aerobic training component was customized for iso-caloric energy expenditure (P=0.217) and iso-load distribution (TRIMP, P=0.893), however the MICT component had a longer aerobic training time (P=0.01). We evaluated pre- and post-evaluation CRF (VO2peak), physical capacity [power of lower limbs (PLL), running velocity, and running time to exhaustion], plasma lactate, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), resting heart rate (HRrest), and peak heart rate (HRpeak). Results: At the end of the intervention, a significant increase in the VO2peak was observed only in the RT+HIIT group (P=0.01), but compared to the CON group both RT+HIIT and RT+MICT groups had significant improvement in the VO2peak (P=0.02). Only the RT+HIIT group had lower HRrest as compared to the baseline and the CON group. Also, both RT+HIIT and RT+MICT groups, but not CON, significantly improved running speed, time to exhaustion, and PLL (P<0.05). There were no significant changes in HRpeak, RPE, and lactate for any of the groups. Conclusion: Our results suggest that 12 weeks of RT+MICT or RT+HIIT improve lower-limb physical performance. Also, our results suggest that RT+HIIT provides additional CRF benefits in older adults with MetS.

Here we report the effect of combining these 2 types of training on performance in the competitive phase. We randomized 18 road cyclists to an experimental (n = 9) or control (n = 9) group for 4-5 weeks of training. The experimental group replaced part of their usual training with twelve 30-minute sessions consisting of 3 sets of explosive single-leg jumps (20 for each leg) alternating with 3 sets of high-resistance cycling sprints (5 3 30 seconds at 60-70 min-1 with 30-second recoveries between repetitions). Performance measures, obtained over 2-3 days on a cycle ergometer before and after the intervention, were mean power in a 1- and 4-km time trial, peak power in an incremental test, and lactate-profile power and oxygen cost determined from 2 fixed submaximal workloads. The control group showed little mean change in performance. Power output sampled in the training sprints of the experimental group indicated a plateau in the training effect after 8-12 sessions. Relative to the control group, the mean changes (690% confidence limits) in the experimental group were: 1-km power, 8.7% (62.5%); 4-km power, 8.1% (64.1%); peak power, 6.8% (63.6); lactate-profile power, 3.7% (64.8%); and oxygen cost, 23.0% (62.6%). Individual responses to the training were apparent only for 4-km and lactate-profile power (standard deviations of 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively). The addition of explosive training and high-resistance interval training to the programs of already well-trained cyclists produces major gains in sprint and endurance performance, partly through improvements in exercise efficiency and anaerobic threshold.

There is still controversy regarding the best and most efficient training method, such as, aerobic (AT), strength (ST) or concurrent (AT+ST) training. The objective of this study was to analyze whether there are differences in morphological and cardiovascular indices among aerobic, strength and concurrent training practitioners. This study recruited 27 healthy men (31.5 ± 13 years) divided into 4 groups: AT group (n: 6); ST (n: 6); AT+ST (n: 10); and control group (CON) (sedentary) (n: 5). Waist circumference, hip waist ratio, body mass index and fat percentage were used for the mofological indices. For the cardiovascular indices data of VO2 max, HR post exercise, and BP at rest were collected. All training groups presented lower levels of %G and waist circumference when compared to the control group. The AT group presented lower hip waist ratio and BMI indexes when compared to the control group and better indices of VO2 max and HRpost than all the other groups. The AT+ST was the only group that presented lower values of diastolic BP when compared to the control group and presented better values of VO2 max and HRpost when compared to the ST and control groups. All training groups were shown to be effective for the reduction of morphological and cardiovascular indices tested in this study. However, it seems that AT and AT+ST are the most recommended form of training for the control and prevention of diseases that are associated with the increase of these indices.

Their effects are likely to be different and complementary. We aimed at comparing in type 2 diabetes a protocol of endurance training precisely targeted at the power intensity of maximal lipid oxidation (LIPOXmax) with a protocol combining resistance and endurance training (Square-Wave Endurance Exercise Test [SWEET] training). Patients and methods: Sixty-three type 2 diabetics (age 52.6±1.5 years; BMI 32.7±0.7) were divided into three groups matched for age, BMI, and HbA1c and were compared over a period of 3 months, without nutritional intervention: 39 were trained at the LIPOXmax determined with exercise calorimetry, 12 were submitted to a SWEET training, and 12 untrained patients served as controls. Results: After 3 months, both procedures increased maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) (SWEET training +42±16.4%, P =0.027 vs LIPOXmax training +14±4.09%, P =0.011). The effect of SWEET training on VO2max was stronger than that of LIPOXmax training (P =0.0016). SWEET training reduced resting systolic blood pressure (–12.08±5.17mmHg, P =0.040) and total cholesterol (–0.29±0.13mmol/L, P =0.049), while LIPOXmax training did not. Both procedures decreased weight and BMI. By contrast, the LIPOXmax training improved the ability to oxidize lipids (maximum lipid oxidation rate +53±13.53mg/min, P =0.0005) shifted it to a higher power intensity (+20.9±4.29 watts, P =0.00002), decreased fat mass (–1±0.37% ; P =0.012), increased fat-free mass (+1±0.37%, P =0.012), decreased waist circumference (–3.76±0.99cm P =0.0007) and hip circumference (–2.18±0.78cm, P =0.009) while SWEET training did not significantly affect any of those parameters. Over this short period the effects of training on HbA1c were significant in the LIPOXmax group (–0.15±0.07%, P =0.044) but not in the SWEET group. Conclusion: This study shows that SWEET training improves aerobic working capacity, blood pressure and lipid profile, while low intensity endurance training (LIPOXmax training) improves the ability to oxidize lipids at exercise, increases fat-free mass, decreases fat mass and decreases HbA1c. The benefits of these two procedures are thus quite different and both are probably interesting to associate in the management of type 2 diabetes.

Forty-seven men (age, 48.1 ± 6.8 years; body mass index, 30.4 ± 4.1 kg·m−2) were randomized into 12-weeks of EET (40-60 min of cycling), RET (10 exercises; 3-4 sets × 8-10 repetitions), CET (50% serial completion of RET and EET), or control condition. The following were determined: intervention-based changes in fitness and strength; abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT), total body fat (TB-FM) and fat-free (TB-FFM) mass; plasma cytokines (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) interleukin-6 (IL-6)); muscle protein content of p110α and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4); mRNA expression of GLUT4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α−β, cytochrome c oxidase, hexokinase II, citrate synthase; oral glucose tolerance; and estimated insulin sensitivity. CET promoted commensurate improvements of aerobic capacity and muscular strength and reduced VAT and TB-FM equivalently to EET and RET ( p < 0.05), yet only RET increased TB-FFM ( p < 0.05). Although TNFα and IL-6 were reduced after all training interventions ( p < 0.05), CRP remained unchanged ( p > 0.05). EET reduced area under the curve for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide, whilst CET and RET respectively reduced insulin and C-peptide, and C-peptide only ( p < 0.05). Notwithstanding increased insulin sensitivity index after all training interventions ( p < 0.05), no change presented for GLUT4 or p110α total protein, or chronic mRNA expression of the studied mitochondrial genes ( p > 0.05). In middle-aged men, 12 weeks of duration-matched CET promoted commensurate changes in fitness and strength, abdominal VAT, plasma cytokines and insulin sensitivity, and an equidistant glucose tolerance response to EET and RET; despite no change of measured muscle mechanisms associative to insulin action, glucose transport, and mitochondrial function.

Methods: The participants were separated into two groups: postmenopausal breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy for an average of 20 months (18 women) and healthy postmenopausal women (24 women). We assessed aerobic capacity (predicted maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and maximum running velocity test (Vmax)) through a walking test, upper and lower body muscle strength using an estimated one-repetition maximum test, and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and at three, six, and nine months, respectively. The exercise program was performed three times/week over nine months and consisted of 40 min of machine-based strength training (seated cable row, bench press, leg extension, leg press, and leg curl, as well as bridge, abdominal, and standard plank exercises) followed by 30 min of treadmill walking. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to compare the groups over time. Results: Postmenopausal breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy and healthy postmenopausal women presented similar improvements in estimated lower body strength, predicted VO2max and Vmax, and body fat mass. For maximal upper body strength, there was a significant group x time interaction after six months of training (p = 0.01). The healthy postmenopausal women presented a significant increase in upper body strength after six months, while postmenopausal breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy demonstrated an improvement only at nine months of training. The breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy presented increased lean mass while healthy postmenopausal women maintained values over time (Breast cancer: 33.7 ± 3.9(Pre) vs. 34.1 ± 3.4 kg (Post) and healthy women: 36.4 ± 5.1 (Pre) vs. 36.4 ± 5.0 kg (Post), p = 0.004). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that postmenopausal women undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer demonstrated adaptations and similar trainability to the same regimen of resistance + aerobic training as healthy postmenopausal women. Combined exercise program (aerobic plus resistance) is an important non-pharmacological strategies to improve strength, aerobic capacity, and body composition in breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the time of intervention seems to influence the upper body strength response in this population. This study showed that trainers and other specialists do not need to modify the prescription of exercise related to healthy women, since the combined exercise program induced similar benefits in strength, aerobic capacity, and body composition in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy and healthy postmenopausal women.

Twenty-two endurance runners (age = 37 ± 6 years, stature = 1.71 ± 0.05 m, body mass = 62.7 ± 8.6 kg, weekly mileage = 47.3 ± 10.8 km) performed a countermovement jump (CMJ) and isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) test during pre- and post-tests. They were then randomly assigned to either PLYO or ISO group and completed 12 sessions of intervention over six weeks. The PLYO included drop jump, single leg bounding and split jump, and the ISO included IMTP and isometric ankle plantar flexion. Significant and large time x group interactions were observed for CMJ countermovement depth (P = 0.037, η²p = 0.21) and IMTP and relative peak force (PF) (P = 0.030, η²p = 0.22). Significant and large main effects for time were observed in CMJ height, peak power, propulsive phase duration, countermovement depth, reactive strength index modified, IMTP PF and relative PF (P < 0.05, 0.20 ≤ η²p ≤ 0.65). Effect for time showed small improvement in CMJ height for both PLYO (P < 0.001, d = 0.48) and ISO (P = 0.009, d = 0.47), small improvement in CMJ PP in PLYO (P = 0.020, d = 0.21), large increase in countermovement depth (P = 0.004, d = 1.02) and IMTP relative PF (P < 0.001, d = 0.87), and moderate increase in propulsive phase duration (P = 0.038, d = 0.65) and IMTP PF (P < 0.001, d = 0.55) in ISO. There were large differences between groups for percentage change in countermovement depth (P = 0.003, d = 0.96) and IMTP relative PF (P = 0.047, d = 0.90). In conclusion, both PLYO and ISO improved CMJ jump height via different mechanisms, while only ISO resulted in improved IMTP PF and relative PF.

Twenty-two subjects performed cardiorespiratory, 1RM tests, and two sessions of strength training with distinct load intensities. The strength protocols were local muscle endurance (LME, 3 sets of 15 to 20 RM repetitions at 50% of 1 RM and a 1 min rest interval between sets) and high load strength training (HLT, 3 sets of 3 to 5 RM repetitions, load of 90% of 1 RM and a 3 min rest interval between sets). At rest, there were no significant differences between the LME and HLT protocols for all variables. During the workout sessions, the LME protocol resulted in significantly (P=0.01) higher VO2, VCO2, VE, O2 pulse, HR, VE /VO2 , and VE /VCO2 responses as well as total volume of training vs. the HLT protocol. Although the LME protocol resulted in a higher cardiorespiratory overload versus the HLT protocol, it was too low to improve the cardiorespiratory fitness of young trained women.

While sport conditioning specialists understand and differentiate the different benefits of resistance training (RT) subtypes on athletic performance, this distinction is less clear for health professionals when designing CVD risk reduction programs. Objectives: This study attempted to investigate and compare the effects of hypertrophy and muscular endurance RT on CVD risk in sedentary males. Methods: Sedentary male smokers were randomly assigned to either an eight-week hypertrophy RT group (HTG) (n = 15), muscular endurance RT groups (METG) (n = 15), or a non-exercising control group (CON) (n = 15) to assess their impact on smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) variables associated with the four most prominent CVD risk factors. Data were analyzed using SPSS-25 software using a paired sample t-test and ANOVA. Results: Significant (P ≤ 0.05) improvements were found in three of the 15 measured variables in the HTG (resting mean arterial pressure (RMAP) (P = 0.024); total cholesterol (TC): HDL-C ratio (P = 0.009), and HDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ratio (P = 0.038), with a deleterious decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P = 0.027). In turn, significant improvements were found in theMETGin 10 of the 15 measured variables, namely; cigarettes smoked per day (P=0.037), resting systolic blood pressure (RSBP) (P = 0.002), resting diastolic blood pressure (RDBP) (P = 0.006), RMAP (P = 0.000), TC (P = 0.010), triglycerides (TG) (P = 0.010), LDL-C (P = 0.007), HDL-C: LDL-C (P = 0.018), non-HDL-C (n-HDL-C) (P = 0.010), and VO2max (P = 0.001), and a deleterious decrease in HDL-C (P = 0.026). Conclusions: While the oversimplification of RT design for CVD reduction has resulted in cardio-centric CVD training programs, this study demonstrates that some subtypes of RT (i.e. muscular endurance training) may prove more useful than others in reducing multiple CVD risk factors simultaneously.

Thus, the main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different periodization models of concurrent aerobic and strength training using equalized training volume programs on muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness in recreationally active postmenopausal women. After 3 weeks of adaptation, 58 women aged 50-75 years were randomly assigned to (a) nonperiodization (NP), (b) daily nonlinear periodization (NLP), or (c) flexible daily NLP (FNLP). At baseline and after 12 weeks, aerobic fitness (peak oxygen uptake [V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak] and the 6-minute walk test) and maximal muscle strength (1 repetition maximum of bench press and leg press) were measured. It was shown that maximal strength increased in the bench press (effect size [ES] 1.18 in NLP and 1.22 in FNLP) and leg press (ES 0.92 in NLP and 0.89 in FNLP) in the periodized groups-in the NP group, these values were 0.49 and 0.46, respectively. In the 6-minute walk test, aerobic fitness statistically improved in all groups-with an ES of 1.02 in the NP, 1.33 in the NLP, and 0.54 in the FNLP. This study showed that only periodization models (NLP and FNLP) induced a moderate ES in maximal strength, and all groups (NP, NLP, and FNLP) demonstrated improved aerobic fitness evaluated by V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and the 6-minute walk test in recreationally active postmenopausal women.

The relative increase in upper body workload in R was significantly greater than A + R at 4 months (161 ± 11% vs 127 ± 11%, P = 0.009) and at 6 months of training (177 ± 11% vs 132 ± 11%, P = 0.008). Both groups had improvements in 8- RM workloads at 3 and 6 months. The resistance training group had a significantly greater improvement in 8- RM on the leg press at 6 months compared with A + R (80 ± 11% vs 58 ± 8%, P = 0.045). Both R and A + R improved strength with a 6-month training program; however, increases in strength may be greater with resistance training alone compared with performing both aerobic and resistance training.

It is regarded as a therapeutic indicator of diabetes due to elevated insulin secretion. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 2 different intensities of combined training on the levels of irisin, betatrophin, and insulin in women with type 2 diabetes. Methods: In this study, 26 female patients with type 2 diabetes were divided into 3 groups of combined high-intensity training, combined moderate-intensity training, and control. The training groups participated in combined training at high or moderate intensities for 8 weeks. The variance analysis test and the Duncan post-hoc test were applied to analyze the data (P > 0.05). Results: Combined training at 2 intensities of moderate and vigorous led to a rise in the levels of irisin, betatrophin, and insulin. Exercise intensity was a determining factor for these elevated levels insofar as combined high-intensity training resulted in higher levels of these hormones than combined moderate-intensity training. Conclusions: It appears that participating in relatively high-intensity training programs may be beneficial for diabetic patients inasmuch as they increase the levels of irisin, betatrophin, and then, insulin.

Community‐dwelling men and women (n = 84; M/F, 45/39; 69.3 ± 3.5 years; 26.4 ± 3.8 kg m−2) were randomly assigned (n = 21 each) to either non‐exercise control (CON), aerobic exercise only (AER), resistance exercise only (RES), or concurrent aerobic and resistance exercise (CEX). Training groups trained three times per week, each performing 72 minutes of active exercise time per week. Body composition, physical and cognitive function, and markers of metabolic health were assessed before (PRE), and after 6 (MID) and 12 (POST) weeks of exercise training. Hand‐grip strength, 1RM chest press, and arm LBM were improved by both RES and CEX, but not AER. Aerobic fitness increased in AER and RES, but not CEX. Cognitive function improved in all groups, but occurred earlier (ie, at MID) in AER. CEX improved gait speed and lower limb strength and reduced trunk fat compared to either AER or RES. Leg LBM was unchanged in any group. Temporal patterns were observed as early as 6 weeks of training (gait speed, upper and lower limb strength, aerobic fitness), whereas others were unchanged until 12 weeks (hand‐grip strength, timed up‐and‐go, sit‐to‐stand). Compared to either aerobic or resistance exercise training alone, concurrent exercise training is as efficacious for improving a range of health‐related parameters and is more efficacious for increasing gait speed and lower limb strength, and decreasing trunk fat in older adults.

A second group (B-4d, N=8) did the S training on 2d.wk-1 and E training on 2 other d.wk-1. S training was six to eight sets of 15-20 RM on a leg press weight machine. E training was six to eight 3-min bouts of cycle ergometer exercise at 90-100 percent VO2max. B-4d (25 percent) increased leg press 1 RM more, but the groups increased similarly (A-2d, B-4d) in knee extensor (31 percent, 34 percent) and flexor (12 percent, 14 percent) cross-sectional area and vastus lateralis mean fiber area (33 percent, 25 percent).

PURPOSE: Compare the effects of 4 weeks (8 sessions) of VBT and Traditional RE training (Trad) on muscular strength, endurance, total load (TL), total RE time (TT), concentric movement velocity (CMV) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). METHODS: 18 males (age 21.7±1.1 yrs) and 20 females (age 20.9±0.7 yrs) were randomly assigned to VBT or Trad groups. Pre and Post-training tests included 1RM right leg, single-leg, leg extension (SL-LE), anthropometry and submaximal RE SL-LE tests to failure (at 60, 75, 90% 1RM). All Ss completed 4 weeks, 2 sessions/week, SL-LE training sessions. During training, VBT completed 3 sets until CMV (for each set) decreased by 20% for two consecutive reps, while Trad completed 3 sets to failure, regardless of CMV. Resistance was progressively increased throughout training. An ultrasound sensor, NI-cRIO and custom-built software (NI-LabView) was used to monitor/record/store data. A 2 (Grp) X 2 (Sex) multivariate ANOVA with Repeated Measures was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Across training, TL (kg) (11167±3260 VBT; 12305±5030 Trad), TT (s) (429.6±53.8 VBT; 521.7±70 Trad) and RPE (8.3±0.4 VBT; 9.2±0.6 Trad) for both sexes combined, were significantly lower for VBT (p<0.05). Following training, both groups and sexes exhibited similar and significant improvements (p<0.05) in muscular strength (17.4±9.2% VBT; 14.6±10.6% Trad) and endurance (increased # reps) at 60% (4.9±4.3 VBT; 3.8±5.3 Trad), 75% (3.21±3.5 VBT; 3.5±3.0 Trad) and 90% (3.9±3.9 VBT; 3.4±3.9 Trad) 1RM. VBT exhibited significantly faster CMV at 75% Peak (0.42±0.08m/s VBT; 0.35±0.04m/s Trad) and 90% Av (0.23±0.05m/s VBT; 0.19±0.04m/s Trad) and Peak (0.36±0.1m/s VBT; 0.27±0.06m/s Trad) (p<0.05). There were no significant group*sex interactions. CONCLUSION: VBT resulted in similar significant increases in muscular strength and endurance and greater increases in CMV at submaximal loads, all while exhibiting significantly lower TT, TL and RPE during RE training, and these changes occurred for females and males, similarly.

However, the compatibility of these two distinct training modes remains unclear. Objective: This systematic review assessed the compatibility of concurrent aerobic and strength training compared with strength training alone, in terms of adaptations in muscle function (maximal and explosive strength) and muscle mass. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the influence of training modality, training type, exercise order, training frequency, age, and training status. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus were systematically searched (12 August 2020, updated on 15 March 2021). Eligibility criteria were as follows. Population: healthy adults of any sex and age; Intervention: supervised concurrent aerobic and strength training for at least 4 weeks; Comparison: identical strength training prescription, with no aerobic training; Outcome: maximal strength, explosive strength, and muscle hypertrophy. Results: A total of 43 studies were included. The estimated standardised mean differences (SMD) based on the random-effects model were − 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] − 0.20 to 0.09; p = 0.446), − 0.28 (95% CI − 0.48 to − 0.08; p = 0.007), and − 0.01 (95% CI − 0.16 to 0.18; p = 0.919) for maximal strength, explosive strength, and muscle hypertrophy, respectively. Attenuation of explosive strength was more pronounced when concurrent training was performed within the same session (p = 0.043) than when sessions were separated by at least 3 h (p > 0.05). No significant effects were found for the other moderators, i.e. type of aerobic training (cycling vs. running), frequency of concurrent training (> 5 vs. < 5 weekly sessions), training status (untrained vs. active), and mean age (< 40 vs. > 40 years). Conclusion: Concurrent aerobic and strength training does not compromise muscle hypertrophy and maximal strength development. However, explosive strength gains may be attenuated, especially when aerobic and strength training are performed in the same session. These results appeared to be independent of the type of aerobic training, frequency of concurrent training, training status, and age. PROSPERO: CRD42020203777.

Seventy-eight football athletes were divided into two separate training groups: complex and combined. Each group performed the same seven-week training routine with one exception. The complex training group performed the plyometric exercises in a super-set with biomechanically similar core resistance exercises while the combined group performed the plyometric exercises separately following the core resistance exercises. All subjects were pre and post-tested with the following strength and field tests: body fat, body weight, bench press, squat, power clean, medicine ball throw, broad jump, vertical jump, pro-agility (I-test), and Omnikinetic testing. General Linear Model (SPSS) analysis revealed significant improvements on eight of these tests comparing pre-test scores to post-test scores. Those tests showing significant improvements were body fat (p=.000), bench press (p=.000), squat (p=.000), power clean (p=.005), medicine ball throw (p=.000), broad jump (p=.000), vertical jump (p=.050), and pro-agility (p=.027). Two measures indicated a significant difference between groups. The bench press improved significantly for the combined versus the complex group (p=.049) and the vertical jump approached significance (p=.057) in favor of the complex training program. The results of this study do not support complex training as a superior program compared to combined training but they do indicate that complex training is not at a disadvantage to a more traditional combined training program.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-171099&site=ehost-live"

Complex training (CPX) is a multicomponent training method, wherein heavy strength and plyometric exercises alternate within a single session and is an effective method to improve neuromuscular adaptations. This study compared the effects of CPX, heavy strength training (HST) and endurance-strength (EST) combined with running endurance training on neuromuscular adaptations and running performance in 38 recreational marathoners (age:31.4 ± 3.8 years, VO2max:57.6 ± 6.8 ml·kg−1·min−1). Athletes were allocated in 3 groups: CPX, HST and EST and were tested for one maximum repetition strength (1RM), squat jump and countermovement jumps (SJ, CMJ), leg press (LP) concentric and eccentric strength, running economy (RE) and velocity at VO2max (vVO2max) before and after the 6-week intervention. CPX and HST were performed 2 times per week in conjunction with the running endurance training. RE and vVO2max improved in CPX and HST groups (p < 0.01, RE: −5% to −6.4%, vVO2max: 5.7% and 4.2%, respectively) with no change in EST. Similarly, all neuromuscular performance indicators improved in CPX and HST (p < 0.0167, 1RM strength:19.7% to 25.1%, SJ and CMJ: 5.3% to 11.6%, LP concentric and eccentric strength: 5.5% to 18.0%). In summary, 6-week of concurrent CPX or HST and endurance training resulted in similar improvement in maximum strength, RE, and vVO2max. Importantly, both CPX and HST training resulted in greater improvements in eccentric strength and RE compared to EST that performed concurrent endurance-strength and endurance training.

Purpose: To describe the characteristics of world-class NC athletes' training and determine how endurance and non-endurance (ie, strength, power, and ski jumping) training is periodized. Methods: Annual training characteristics and the periodization of endurance and non-endurance training were determined by analyzing the training diaries of 6 world-class NC athletes. Results: Of 846 ± 72 annual training hours, 540 ± 37 h were endurance training, with 88.6% being low-, 5.9% moderate-, and 5.5% high-intensity training. While training frequency remained relatively constant, the total training volume was reduced from the general preparatory to the competition phase, primarily due to less low- and moderate-intensity training (P < .05). A total of 236 ± 55 h/y were spent as non-endurance training, including 211 ± 44 h of power and ski-jump-specific training (908 ± 165 ski jumps and ski-jump imitations). The proportion of non-endurance training increased significantly toward the competition phase (P < .05). Conclusion: World-class NC athletes reduce the volume of low- and moderate-intensity endurance training toward the competition phase, followed by an increase in the relative contribution of power and ski-jump training. These data provide novel insight on how successful athletes execute their training and may facilitate more-precise coaching of future athletes in this sport. In addition, this information is of high relevance for the training organization of other sports that require optimization of 2 fundamentally different physical capacities.

Nineteen male cross-country skiers were assigned to an experimental group (E, n = 8) or a control group (C, n = 11). The E group trained for 8 weeks with the same total training volume as C, but 27% of endurance training in E was replaced by explosive strength training. The skiers were measured at preand post training for concentric and isometric force-time parameters of leg extensors and EMG activity from the vastus lateralis (VL) and medialis (VM) muscles. Sport-specific rapid force production was measured by performing a 30-m double poling test with the maximal velocity (V30DP) and sport-specific endurance economy by constant velocity 2-km double poling test (CVDP) and performance (V2K) by 2-km maximal double poling test with roller skis on an indoor track. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was determined during the maximal treadmill walking test with the poles. The early absolute forces (0-100 ms) in the force-time curve in isometric action increased in E by 18 ± 22% (p < 0.05), with concomitant increases in the average integrated EMG (IEMG) (0-100 ms) of VL by 21 ± 21% (p < 0.05). These individual changes in the average IEMG of VL correlated with the changes in early force (r = 0.86, p < 0.01) in E. V30DP increased in E (1.4 ± 1.6%) (p < 0.05) but not in C. The V2K increased in C by 2.9 ± 2.8% (p < 0.01) but not significantly in E (5.5 ± 5.8%, p < 0.1). However, the steady-state oxygen consumption in CVDP decreased in E by 7 ± 6% (p < 0.05). No significant changes occurred in VO2max either in E or in C. The present concurrent explosive strength and endurance training in endurance athletes produced improvements in explosive force associated with increased rapid activation of trained leg muscles. The training also led to more economical sport-specific performance. The improvements in neuromuscular characteristics and economy were obtained without a decrease in maximal aerobic capacity, although endurance training was reduced by about 20%.

Sixty‐six MetS individuals (37% women, age 56 ± 7 years, BMI 32 ± 5 kg m−2 and 3.8 ± 0.8 MetS factors) were randomized to undergo one of the following 16‐week isocaloric exercise programs: (i) 4 + 1 bouts of 4 min at 90% of HRMAX of intense aerobic cycling (IAC + IAC group; n = 33), (ii) 4 IAC bouts followed by 3 sets of 12 repetitions of 3 lower‐limb free‐weight exercises (IAC + RT group; n = 33). We measured the effects of training on maximal cycling power, leg press maximum strength (1RM), countermovement jump height (CMJ), and mean propulsive velocity (MPV) at workloads ranging from 10% to 100% of baseline 1RM leg press. After intervention, MetS components (Z‐score) improved similarly in both groups (p = 0.002). Likewise, maximal cycling power during a ramp test improved similarly in both groups (time effect p < 0.001). However, leg press 1RM improved more in IAC + RT than in IAC + IAC (47 ± 5 vs 13 ± 5 kg, respectively, interaction p < 0.001). CMJ only improved with IAC + RT (0.8 ± 0.2 cm, p = 0.001). Leg press MPV at heavy loads (ie, 80%–100% 1RM) improved more with concurrent training (0.12 ± 0.01 vs 0.06 ± 0.02 m s−1, interaction p = 0.013). In conclusion, in unconditioned MetS individuals, intense aerobic cycling alone improves leg muscle performance. However, substituting 20% of intense aerobic cycling by resistance training further improves 1RM leg press, MPV at high loads, and jumping ability while providing similar improvement in MetS components.

Twenty-three female breast cancer survivors (50±8 years) were randomized to a high- (n=13) or a moderate-intensity (n=10) training program. Both interventions lasted 16 weeks and included the same resistance exercises, but the aerobic component was supervised and more intense in the former (i.e., rating of perceived exertion of 7–8 vs. 6 on a 1–10 scale for the high and moderate-intensity intervention, respectively). The primary endpoint was fatigue perception. Endpoints were assessed at baseline and after 16 weeks. The p-value for statistical significance was set at 0.004 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The high-intensity training program increased lower-limb muscle strength significantly (p=0.002) and tended to improve fatigue perception (p=0.006), waist circumference (p=0.013), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p=0.028) and some quality of life items (p=0.011). Although the moderate-intensity training program did not provide such benefits in general (i.e., higher p-values for pre vs post-intervention comparisons), no significant differences were found between interventions (all p>0.004). Further research is needed to elucidate if the benefits provided by high-intensity concurrent training are superior to those elicited by moderate-intensity training in breast cancer survivors.

Methods: Nineteen subjects (10 males and 9 females; 21.0 ± 2.5 yr, 65.4 ± 12.2 kg) were separated into two groups: 1) 10-d ULLS only (n = 9) and 2) 10-d ULLS plus aerobic and resistance training (ULLS + EX, n = 10). Exercise was performed on a single gravity-independent Multi-Mode Exercise Device (M-MED) with alternating days of high-intensity interval aerobic training and maximal exertion resistance training. Results: Aerobic capacity increased by 7% in ULLS + EX (P < 0.05). Knee extensor and ankle plantar flexor three-repetition maximum increased in the ULLS + EX group (P < 0.05), but this change was only different from ULLS in the plantar flexors (P < 0.05). Peak torque levels decreased with ULLS but were increased for the knee extensors and attenuated for the ankle plantar flexors with ULLS + EX (P < 0.05). A shift toward type IIx myosin heavy-chain mRNA occurred with ULLS and was reversed with ULLS + EX in the vastus lateralis (P< 0.05) but not the soleus. Myostatin and atrogin increased with ULLS in both the vastus lateralis and soleus, but this change was mitigated with ULLS + EX only in the vastus lateralis (P = 0.0551 for myostatin, P < 0.05 for atrogin). Citrate synthase was decreased in the soleus during ULLS but was increased with ULLS + EX (P < 0.05). Conclusion: These results indicate that an M-MED class countermeasure device appears to be effective at mitigating the deconditioning effects of microgravity simulated during a modified ULLS protocol.

A secondary aim was to report prevalence of non‐responders for the different study outcomes. Physically inactive overweight/obese and hyperglycemic adult women (42 ± 6 years; BMI = 30.9 ± 4.8 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to a 20‐week CT intervention group or a control (non‐exercise) group (CG) (n = 14/group). Cardiovascular risk factors for body composition (body mass, waist circumference [WC], fat mass, and lean mass), blood pressure, and lipid profile (total, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose) were assessed before and after the 20‐week intervention. Our results show that a CT intervention results in a reduction of comorbidities in terms of abdominal obesity and cardiovascular risk in adult women with hyperglycemia by decreasing WC and improving lipid profile in ""mean"" terms. At the individual level, after CT, some subjects changed their status from a ""high"" to a ""low"" cardiovascular risk in terms of WC, while others changed from hypertension to either high blood pressure or normotension, or from high blood pressure to normotension, and others changed from hypercholesterolemia/dyslipidemia to normocholesterolemia. Overall, there were ~30%, 50%, and 20% of individuals in the CT exercise group who showed no change/adverse response for body composition, blood pressure, and lipid profile, respectively, after the 20‐week CT intervention.

Eleven obese (body mass index BMI &gt; 27.0 kg/m2) and 13 control (BMI &lt; 27.0 kg/m2) females participated in the investigation. Three series of anthropometrical measurements were taken according to the O-scale Physique Assessment System. The ratio of waist to hip circumference (WHR) was calculated. Body composition was measured with the bioelectrical impedance method (Bodystat 500, UK). Individual physical working capacity (PWC) was measured with the cycle ergometer test. One repetition maximum leg extension (1RM LE) was used to assess maximal isoinertial strength. Training sessions were performed three times per week and resistance training consisted of four exercises (leg extension, bench press, sit-ups, leg press). The subjects performed four circuits at maximal possible speed, using a work-to-rest ratio of 60 sec. The 75 % 1RM load and 8-12 repetitions per set were used. The duration of resistance exercises was 32 min, which was followed by 30 min of continuous walking at the intensity of approximately 75 % maximum heart rate. Obese women had significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) values for skin-fold, girth and breadth measurements. PWC and 1RM LE strength was also significantly higher in the obese group. WHR was significantly negatively related to all measured physical fitness indices in obese but not the control subjects. While lean body mass was significantly positively related to all measured physical fitness values in obese but not control subjects. Body weight, body fat %, body fat amount and sum of 8SF were significantly decreased as a result of the training programme in middle-aged obese females. While no significant effects of training programme on body composition characteristics were observed in middle-aged control women. PWC values were significantly increased in both groups studied as a result of training programme. While 1RM LE strength was significantly increased after the training only in control subjects. In conclusion, the concurrent resistance and endurance training programme for the improvement of physical fitness of middle-aged obese females appears to be an acceptable form of physical activity to reduce body weight and increase cardiovascular fitness.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-668799&site=ehost-live"

This study examined whether concurrent MST and PF training would induce similar training responses as each training mode alone. Ten patients with PAD underwent 8 weeks of concurrent leg press MST and PF training, three times a week. The reference group ( n=10) received recommended exercise guidelines. The training group improved treadmill peak oxygen consumption and incremental protocol time to exhaustion with 12.7 ± 7.7% and 12.6 ± 13.2%. Leg press maximal strength and rate of force development improved with 38.3 ± 3.1% and 140.1 ± 40.3%, respectively, along with a 5.2 ± 6.2% within group work economy improvement. No changes appeared in the reference group.

Our understanding of the nature of this inhibition and the mechanisms responsible for it is limited at present. This is due to the difficulties associated with comparing results of studies which differ markedly in a number of design factors, including the mode, frequency, duration and intensity of training, training history of participants, scheduling of training sessions and dependent variable selection. Despite these difficulties, both chronic and acute hypotheses have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of strength inhibition during concurrent training. The chronic hypothesis contends that skeletal muscle cannot adapt metabolically or morphologically to both strength and endurance training simultaneously. This is because many adaptations at the muscle level observed in response to strength training are different from those observed after endurance training. The observation that changes in muscle fibre type and size after concurrent training are different from those observed after strength training provide some support for the chronic hypothesis. The acute hypothesis contends that residual fatigue from the endurance component of concurrent training compromises the ability to develop tension during the strength element of concurrent training. It is proposed that repeated acute reductions in the quality of strength training sessions then lead to a reduction in strength development over time. Peripheral fatigue factors such as muscle damage and glycogen depletion have been implicated as possible fatigue mechanisms associated with the acute hypothesis. Further systematic research is necessary to quantify the inhibitory effects of concurrent training on strength development and to identify different training approaches that may overcome any negative effects of concurrent training.

Strength training typically results in increases in muscle mass and muscle strength. In contrast, endurance training induces increases in maximal oxygen uptake and metabolic adaptations that lead to an increased exercise capacity. In many sports, a combination of strength and endurance training is required to improve performance, but in some situations when strength and endurance training are performed simultaneously, a potential interference in strength development takes place, making such a combination seemingly incompatible. The phenomenon of concurrent training, or simultaneously training for strength and endurance, was first described in the scientific literature in 1980 by Robert C. Hickson, and although work that followed provided evidence for and against it, the interference effect seems to hold true in specific situations. At the molecular level, there seems to be an explanation for the interference of strength development during concurrent training; it is now clear that different forms of exercise induce antagonistic intracellular signaling mechanisms that, in turn, could have a negative impact on the muscle's adaptive response to this particular form of training. That is, activation of AMPK by endurance exercise may inhibit signaling to the protein-synthesis machinery by inhibiting the activity of mTOR and its downstream targets. The purpose of this review is to briefly describe the problem of concurrent strength and endurance training and to examine new data highlighting potential molecular mechanisms that may help explain the inhibition of strength development when strength and endurance training are performed simultaneously.

However, it should be carefully prescribed, as there are some factors, as the training intensity, which have strong influence on training adaptations. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to analyze the scientific evidence regarding aerobic and resistance exercise intensities during CT and their effect on performance outcomes. The effects of exercise intensity on a subsequent detraining period were also assessed. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, the risk of bias was assessed, and the percentage of changes and effect sizes were quantified. CT improved running times (10 m, 30 m and 10 km) and strength performance (one-repetition maximum, countermovement jump) regardless of exercise intensity used (4–47%, ES=0.4–2.8). Nevertheless, higher aerobic training intensities (≥ lactate threshold intensity) resulted in higher aerobic gains (5–10%, ES=0.3–0.6), and greater neuromuscular adaptations were found when higher resistance loads (≥ 70% of maximal strength) were used (10–14%, ES=0.4–1.3). Most training-induced gains were reversed after 2–4 weeks of detraining. Although further research is needed, it seems that higher intensities of aerobic or resistance training induce greater aerobic or neuromuscular gains, respectively. Nevertheless, it seems that higher resistance training loads should be combined with lower aerobic training intensities for increased strength gains and minimal losses after detraining.

Thirty-nine men were randomly assigned to a low-intensity group (LIG), moderate-intensity group (MIG), high-intensity group (HIG), and a control group. The training program consisted of full squat, jumps, sprints, and running at 80% (LIG), 90% (MIG), or 100% (HIG) of the maximal aerobic speed for 16-20 minutes. The training period lasted for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of detraining. Evaluations included 20-m sprints (0-10 m: T10; 0-20 m: T20), shuttle run, countermovement jump (CMJ), and strength (1RMest) in full squat. There were significant improvements from pre-training to post-training in T10 (LIG: 4%; MIG: 5%; HIG: 2%), T20 (3%; 4%; 2%), CMJ (9%; 10%; 7%), 1RMest (13%; 7%; 8%), and oxygen uptake (...O2max; 10%; 11%; 10%). Comparing the changes between the experimental groups, 1RMest gains were significantly higher in the LIG than HIG (5%) or MIG (6%). Furthermore, there was a tendency for higher gains in LIG and MIG compared with HIG, with ""possibly"" or ""likely"" positive effects in T10, T20, and CMJ. Detraining resulted in performance decrements, but minimal losses were found for ...O2max in LIG (-1%). Concurrent training seems to be beneficial for strength and aerobic development regardless of the aerobic training intensity. However, choosing lower intensities can lead to increased strength and is recommended when the cardiorespiratory gains should be maintained for longer.

Objective: To analyze the effects of concurrent training (aerobic+resistance) and taurine supplementation on the metabolic profile of postmenopausal women. Methods: Forty-three postmenopausal women were randomly divided into the following groups: Control (C [N=13]), Taurine (T [N = 8]), Taurine+Exercise (TE [N=13]), and Placebo+Exercise (E [N=9]). The supplemented groups received capsules corresponding to a daily taurine intake of 1.5 g. Concurrent training (CT) took place three times a week and consisted of 50 minutes of resistance training and 30 minutes of aerobic training. Body composition was assessed using DXA, in addition to biochemical profile analysis: triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The intervention period lasted for eight weeks. Statistical significance was set at 5%. Results: The TE group presented a statistical reduction in terms of relative change in the percentage of total body fat (%) (-4.1±3.0) and trunk fat (%) (-4.4±3.9), with greater lean body mass (kg) gain (3.9±2.5) when compared to groups C (0.3±3.7, p=0.005; 0.8±4.3, p=0.024; -1.1±3.1, p<0.001; respectively) and T (1.2±3.4, p=0.004; 1.6±5.4, p=0.023; -1.2±2.9; p=0.002; respectively). The TE group presented a greater percentage reduction of total cholesterol (-5.8±7.1 mg/dl) when compared to group T (11.5±19.1 mg/dl). The TE group presented a significant decrease in LDL-c (-13.6±9.2 mg/dl) compared to groups C (3.5±13.9 mg/dl, p=0.014) and T (9.9±24.3 mg/dl, p=0.027). Conclusion: The combination of concurrent training and taurine supplementation promoted a reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-c levels in postmenopausal women.

The aerobic exercise intensity, mode, volume, duration of recovery interval between exercises, muscle groups involved, and utilization of ergogenic aids are the variables identified in this review. High-intensity interval aerobic exercises result in more pronounced negative effects on strength-endurance exercise but not in maximal strength. Cycling results in more negative effects on strength-endurance performance exercise than running. A 4-hour to 8-hour recovery interval seems to be enough to avoid interference on strength-endurance performance. Reduction in strength-endurance performance is located in muscle groups involved in both exercises. Low aerobic exercise volume (3 km) with ∼18 minutes of duration does not diminish strength endurance, whereas higher volumes (5 and 7 km) with ∼30 and ∼42 minutes of duration, respectively, generate impairments. Caffeine, carbohydrate, and beta-alanine are not able to revert the deleterious effect on strength-endurance performance, whereas creatine and capsaicin analog supplementation are. Thus, these variables must be taken into consideration to prescribe and organize a CT session. This information may help coaches to organize exercise sessions that minimize or avoid the impairment in strength performance after aerobic exercises.

In both experiments, subjects were divided into two groups (serial CE and integrated CE) matched for initial physical condition and trained in a vigorous 3-day per week CE program of 9 (men) to 11 (women) weeks. The two CE training protocols were equilibrated for exercise mode, intensity, and volume, differing only in the timing and sequence of exercises. During training, serial CE discernibly (p < 0.05) increased cardiovascular adaptation in women, indicated by reduction (-5.7%) in active heart rate (HR) (HR/aerobic exercise intensity), whereas integrated CE discernibly reduced active HR in women (-10.7%) and men (-9.1%). Before and after comparisons in the larger sample of women showed that serial CE discernibly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (-8.7% and -14.0%, respectively), increased estimated [latin capital V with dot above]o2max (18.9%), and produced a trend (0.10 > p > 0.05) toward reduced resting HR (-4.9%).

Integrated CE produced discernibly larger gains than serial CE or a trend for four of six training adaptations. Effect sizes were generally large (60.0% of discernible differences). We conclude that, for cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory adaptations in athletes, strength and endurance training are compatible and that exercise timing and sequence significantly influence training adaptations, complimenting our previous similar conclusions for strength, muscle endurance, body composition, and flexibility.

Twenty-eight women (mean age, 19.6 years) were divided into two matched groups and evaluated before and after a vigorous, 11-week, 3-days per week CE training program. One group did serial CE consisting of a warm-up, resistance exercises at low heart rate (HR), aerobics, and a range of motion cool down.

Serial CE produced discernible (p < 0.05) increases in lower- (17.2%) and upper- (19.0%) body muscle strength and fat-free mass (FFM) (1.8%) and trends toward greater lower-body muscle endurance (18.2%) and reduced upper-body flexibility (-160.4%).

Thirty-two men were randomly assigned to 4 groups: low-load (LLG, n = 9), moderate-load (MLG, n = 9), high-load (HLG, n = 8), and control group (CG, n = 6). Resistance training consisted of full squat (FS) with a low load (40-55% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]), a moderate load (55-70% 1RM), or a high load (70-85% 1RM) combined with jump and sprint exercises. Aerobic training was performed at 75% of the maximal aerobic speed for 15-20 minutes. The training period lasted for 8-week, followed by 4-week DT. Pretraining, post-training, and post-DT evaluations included 20-m running sprints (0-10 m: T10; 0-20 m: T20), shuttle run test, countermovement vertical jump (CMJ) test, and loading test (1RM) in FS. All the experimental groups showed improvements (p ≤ 0.05) in all the parameters assessed, except the LLG for T10 and the HLG for T20. The LLG, MLG, and HLG showed great changes in 1RM and ...O2max compared with the CG (p ≤ 0.05), whereas the HLG and MLG showed a greater percentage change than the CG in T10 (p < 0.001) and CMJ (p ≤ 0.05). The 4-week DT period resulted in detrimental effects in all variables analyzed for all 3 experimental groups. In conclusion, our results suggest that strength training programs with low, moderate, or high external loads combined with low-intensity aerobic training could be effective for producing significant gains in strength and aerobic capacities. Moreover, the higher loads used increased gains in explosive efforts. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=128249709&site=ehost-live"

Hickson showed in 1980 that the addition of a resistance-training protocol to a predominantly aerobic program could lead to impaired leg-strength adaptations in comparison with a resistance-only training regimen. This interference phenomenon was later highlighted in many reports, including a meta-analysis. However, it seems that the interference effect has not been consistently reported, probably because of the complex interactions between training variables and methodological issues. On the other side of the medal, Dr Hickson et al subsequently (1986) reported that a strength-training mesocycle could be beneficial for endurance performance in running and cycling. In recent meta-analyses and review articles, it was demonstrated that such a training strategy could improve middle- and long-distance performance in many disciplines (running, cycling, cross-country skiing, and swimming). Notably, it appears that improvements in the energy cost of locomotion could be associated with these performance enhancements. Despite these benefits, it was also reported that strength training could represent a detrimental stimulus for endurance performance if an inappropriate training plan has been prepared. Taken together, these observations suggest that coaches and athletes should be careful when concurrent training seems imperative to meet the complex physiological requirements of their sport. This brief review presents a practical appraisal of concurrent training for sports performance. In addition, recommendations are provided so that practitioners can adapt their interventions based on the training objectives.

Concurrent training (CT - aerobic plus resistance training) is a nonpharmacological tool for T2D treatment that decreases body fat, increases lean body mass, and improves functional capacity. However, it is unknown whether the positive alterations on body composition and cardiometabolic parameters induced by CT occur in different magnitudes for those with T2D who are treated with insulin or not as drug therapy. Purpose: to evaluate the effects of 12 weeks of CT on the body composition of elderly individuals with T2D treated with insulin or not. Approach: Sixteen subjects (age, 65 ± 7 years; T2D length, 11 ± 7 years) were divided into two groups: insulin-treated (IT; n = 9) and noninsulin-treated (NIT; n = 7), who participated in the same incremental-load CT protocol. Results: CT decreased fat body mass (30.5 ± 3.8 kg post-training vs. 32.5 ± 4.5 kg pretraining; p < 0.01; effect size (d) = 0.47) and increased lean body mass (45.6 ± 5.5 kg post-training vs. 43.7 ± 4.4 kg pretraining; p < 0.01; d = 0.4) only in the IT group. CT increased muscle strength (IT: d = 1.71; NIT: d = 1.48; p < 0.05) and the distance traveled during the 6-minute walk test (IT: 519 ± 43 m post-training vs. 499 ± 45 m pretraining, p < 0.05; NIT: 546 ± 94 m post-training vs. 488 ± 58 m pretraining, p < 0.05) for both groups. Conclusion: CT leads to positive body compositions for those with T2D treated with insulin.

The main research conclusions can be summarized as: i) Resistance training can be reliable to improve muscle strength in prepubertal children; ii) A proper and quantifiable exercise frequency and intensity in aerobic training remains unclear; iii) No differences have been found between prepubertal girls and boys on strength and aerobic capacity improvements after intrasession concurrent training , resistance or aerobic training alone; iv) In adults, concurrent resistance and aerobic training seems to be more effective on improvements of aerobic capacity than aerobic training alone; v) Aerobic training biomechanically specific to the concurrent resistance training may minimize adaptation interference when concurrently training; vi) In adolescents, concurrent resistance and aerobic training is equally effective to improve explosive strength compared to resistance training alone, and more efficient in aerobic capacity than resistance training alone; vii) Optimum training sequence was determined by the individual purposes of the training program; viii) Performing aerobic prior to resistance training produces endurance gains, while performing resistance prior to aerobic training appears to be more adequate to obtain strength improvements; ix) In adults, performing concurrent training in different sessions seems to be more effective to improve muscular strength than intra-session concurrent training. These results can be helpful for coaches, teachers and researchers to optimize explosive strength and cardiorespiratory fitness training in sports club and school-based programs, as well as a reliable source for further researches.

Of note, 168 healthy children, aged 10-11 years (10.9 ± 0.5), were randomly selected and assigned to 3 training groups to train twice a week for 8 weeks: GS (n = 41), GCOM1 (n = 45), GCOM2 (n = 38) groups, and a control group (GC) (n = 44; no training program). The GC maintained the baseline level, and trained-induced differences were found in the experimental groups. Differences were observed in the 1 and 3-kg medicine ball throws (GS: +5.8 and +8.1%, respectively; GCOM1 : +5.7 and +8.7%, respectively; GCOM2: +6.2 and +8%, respectively, p < 0.001) and in the countermovement jump height and in the standing long jump length (GS: +5.1 and +5.2%, respectively; GCOM1: +4.2 and +7%, respectively; GCOM2: +10.2 and +6.4%, respectively, p < 0.001). In addition, the training period induced gains in the 20-m time (GS: +2.1%; GCOM1 : +2.1%; GCOM2: +2.3%, p < 0.001 ). It was shown that the experimental groups (GCOM1, GCOM2, and GS) increased ...o2max, muscular strength, and explosive strength from pretraining to posttraining. The higher gains were observed for concurrent training when it was performed in different sessions. These results suggest that concurrent training in 2 different sessions seems to be an effective and useful method for training-induced explosive strength and ...o2max in prepubescent children. This could be considered as an alternative way to optimize explosive strength training and cardiorespiratory fitness in school-based programs.

Methods: Thirty-six amateur rugby sevens players were randomly assigned to strength and short interval training (INT), strength and sprint interval training (SIT), or a strength-only training group (CON) during an 8-wk period. Maximal strength and power tests, aerobic measurements (peak oxygen uptake [VO2peak] and maximal aerobic velocity), and a specific repeated-sprint ability (RSA) test were conducted before and immediately after the overall training period. Results: From magnitude-based inference and effect size (ES ± 90% confidence limit) analyses, the current study revealed substantial gains in maximal strength and jump-height performance in all groups. The difference in change of slow concentric torque production was greater in CON than in SIT (0.65 ± 0.72, moderate). VO2peak and, consequently, mean performance in the RSA test were improved in the SIT group only (0.64 ± 0.29, moderate; -0.54 ± 0.35, moderate). Conclusions: The study did not emphasize interference on strength development after INT but showed a slight impairment of slow concentric torque production gains after SIT. Compared with INT, SIT would appear to be more effective to develop VO2peak and RSA but could induce lower muscle-strength gains, especially at low velocity.

Different studies have suggested combining endurance with resistance training because if the training of these two capacities is designed appropriately, the functional and performance level rises positively. Sports like rugby it is essential to train these two conditional skills, since the rugby player is required to run for short distances and repeatedly. The match lasts a lot and run for 80 minutes on a field, opposing rivals requires appropriate training, not all aerobic capacity, but also very high levels of strength and power. Despite the countless studies done to best combine the training of these two capacities without creating interference, we still do not have clear guidelines to avoid it altogether. This work is a practical proposal of how the CT can be employed through an intra-session and inter-session training in an elite rugby team.

This combination can be challenging and can influence training adaptations, being a problematic issue for coaches. The main objective is to provide coaches with a practical proposal for CT to improve athletes' performance in different sports.

Methods: Thirty‐six older men (67.1 ± 5.1 years) were randomized into three groups: one performing repetitions to failure (RFG, n = 13), another performing repetitions not to failure and 50% of the repetitions of the RFG (NFG, n = 12), and a third performing repetitions not to failure with equal training volume of the RFG (ENFG, n = 11). Training was performed twice a week for 20 weeks at intensities ranging from 65% to 80% of maximal strength. In each session, the individuals started with strengthening exercises and then performed aerobic exercise on a treadmill. Before and after the intervention, individuals were assessed for their one repetition maximum (1RM) for leg press (LP) and knee extension (KE) exercises, knee extensors' isometric peak torque (PTiso), and rate of torque development (RTD) at 50 ms, 100 ms, and 250 ms, muscle thickness of the quadriceps, as well as functional performance on sit‐to‐stand, and timed up and go tests. Results: After training, there were significant (P < 0.001) increases in the LP and KE 1RM, PTiso, and RTD outcomes in all groups. Also, there were significant increases in muscle thickness of the quadriceps and in the sit‐to‐stand test (P < 0.05) in all groups. No significant differences were observed between groups in any outcome. Conclusion: Concurrent training using repetitions to concentric failure did not promote additional benefits for neuromuscular function, muscle thickness, or functional capacity of older individuals.

The aim of the study was to examine the acute effects of cycling or running sprint interval exercise on subsequent resistance training sessions. Twenty-five competitive male rugby union players were recruited. Players were tested during three conditions: CONTROL (resistance training session only), CYCLE and RUN (corresponding to a concurrent training scheme with cycling or running sprint interval exercise conducted on the morning, followed by a resistance training session). Four hours rest was proposed between the aerobic and resistance training session. Muscle performance (bar velocity during bench press and box squat, counter movement jump height) and subjective ratings (rate of perceived exertion, wellbeing) were assessed during and after aerobic or resistance training sessions. No significant difference was observed for muscle performance (vertical jump height and bar velocity). However, significant higher perceived exertion and low-value scaled subjective wellbeing were observed in RUN (7.7 ± 1.1 and 17.9 ± 4.1, respectively) as compared with the two other conditions (6.7 ± 1.5 and 21.1 ± 3.6 for CONTROL and 7.4 ± 1.1 and 20.1 ± 3.9 for CYCLE). It was concluded that the exercise modality (running or cycling) during the aerobic exercise using a sprint interval exercise did not impact the quality of the resistance session. However, subjective ratings were affected the following days. Cycling exercises might be more adequate when performing a sprint interval training session during concurrent training programs.

In the non-randomized clinical trial, 19 participants, 11 healthy (HIV–) and 18 PLWHA under the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 1 year (HIV+). All participants engaged in a moderate-intensity CT program for 12 weeks, 3 times a week. Before and after CT, aerobic and strength performance were assessed, as well as anthropometric and biochemical blood profiles. In addition, SAT biopsies were performed for histologic and morphometric analyses. Statistical analysis was carried out with R Studio, using descriptive and inferential analysis, ANOVA test, and mixed-effect model (P < 0.05). HIV+ showed higher levels of very-low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoproteins at baseline than HIV– (P < 0.05). All groups showed improved aerobic and strength performances (P < 0.05). Both groups showed reduced adipocyte sizes after CT (P < 0.05). Lastly, HIV+ presented smaller adipocytes and higher elastic fiber deposition at baseline and decreased after training only in HIV+, similar to the HIV group. Thus, CT in PLWHA promoted a decrease in the size heterogeneity of adipocytes and elastic fiber deposition, remodeling the ECM, and improving the SAT fibrosis profile.

A total of 44 young women were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: concurrent strength and continuous running training (SCR, n = 10), concurrent strength and interval running training (SIR, n = 11), concurrent strength and continuous cycle ergometer training (SCE, n = 11), or strength training only (STO, n = 12). Each group trained twice a week during 11 weeks. The following strength measurements were made on all subjects before and after training period: maximal strength (1RM) in knee extension, bench press and leg press exercises; local muscular endurance (number of repetitions at 70% of 1 RM) in knee extension and bench press exercises; and isometric and isokinetic peak torque of knee extension. There were significant increases in the upper and lower-body 1 RM, isometric and isokinetic peak torque in all training groups (p < 0.001), with no differences between groups. The present results suggest that in young women, concurrent training performed twice a week promotes similar neuromuscular adaptations to strength training alone, regardless of the type and the intensity in which the aerobic training is performed.

Eight men [22.9 ± 6.3 yr, body mass of 73.2 ± 4.5 kg, peak O2 uptake (Vo2peak) of 54.0 ± 5.7 ml· kg-1· min-1] were randomly assigned to complete trials consisting of either resistance exercise (8 X 5 leg extension, 80% 1 repetition maximum) followed by a bout of endurance exercise (30 mm cycling, 70% Vo2peak) or vice versa. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis at rest, 15 mm after each exercise bout, and after 3 h of passive recovery to determine early signaling and mRNA responses. Phosphorylation of Akt and Akt1Ser473 were elevated 15 mm after resistance exercise compared with cycling, with the greatest increase observed when resistance exercise followed cycling (∼55%; P < 0.01). TSC2- mTOR-S6 kinase phosphorylation is mm after each bout of exercise was similar regardless of the exercise mode. The cumulative effect of combined exercise resulted in disparate mRNA responses. IGF-I mRNA content was reduced when cycling preceded resistance exercise (-42%), whereas muscle ring finger mRNA was elevated when cycling was undertaken after resistance exercise (∼52%; P < 0.05). The hexokinase II mRNA level was higher after resistance cycling (∼45%; P < 0.05) than after cycling-resistance exercise, whereas modest increases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-la mRNA did not reveal an order effect. We conclude that acute responses to diverse bouts of contractile activity are modified by the exercise order. Moreover, undertaking divergent exercise in close proximity influences the acute molecular profile and likely exacerbates acute ""interference.""

To test this premise, 14 healthy, untrained men trained four days per week for 20 weeks on a bicycle ergometer for endurance (END Group, n=4), on an isokinetic device for increased torque production (ITP Group, n=5), or on both devices(COMBO Group, n=5). The ITP and COMBO groups had equal torque gains throughout the study (234 plus/minus 45 and 232 plus/minus 23 N.m, respectively). After 11 weeks, both END and COMBO groups had similar gains in maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2max) (in milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute). During the last half of the study, however, the END Group had a significant gain in Vo2max Group had a nonsignificant gain of 1.8 plus/minus 0.6 mL.kg-1.min-1. In harmony with this finding, the END Group showed a significant increase in citrate synthase activity (15.5 plus/minus 7.9 mumol.g-1.min-1), whereas the COMBO Group had no significant increase. The authors concluded that simultaneous training may inhibit the normal adaptation to either training program when performed alone. The extent of the interference probably depends on the nature and intensity of the individual training program.

Two types of weight training, 60% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) with repetitions to exhaustion and 80% of 1RM with limited repetitions, were compared to determine if blood lactate measurements, as an estimate of rapid substrate-level ATP turnover, provide a significant contribution to the interpretation of total energy expenditure as compared with oxygen uptake methods alone. The measurement of total energy expenditure consisted of blood lactate, exercise oxygen uptake, and a modified excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC); oxygen uptake-only measurements consisted of exercise oxygen uptake and EPOC. When data from male and female subjects were pooled, total energy expenditure was significantly higher for reps to exhaustion (arm curl, 127 kJ; bench press, 127 kJ; leg press, 138 kJ; p < 0.03) and limited reps (arm curl, 112 kJ; bench press, 123 kJ; leg press, 1 24 kJ; p < 0.05) when a separate measure of blood lactate was part of the interpretation. When the data from men and women were analyzed separately, blood lactate often made a significant contribution to total energy expenditure for reps to exhaustion (endurance-type training), but this trend was not always statistically evident for the limited reps (strength-type training) protocol. It is suggested that the estimation of total energy expenditure for weight training is improved with the inclusion, rather than the omission, of an estimate of rapid anaerobic substrate-level ATP turnover.

Reports from laboratory-based studies have revealed a relationship between resistance training and endurance performance in both trained and untrained individuals. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the contribution of lower extremity muscular strength levels in performing cardiorespiratory fitness tests in laboratory, as well as field-based settings. Methods. Within 2 weeks 38 healthy males (age 21.6 +/- 2.5 years, body mass index - BMI - 24.4 +/- 2.2) performed three maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) assessments using the 20 m multistage shuttle run test (MSR), the 20 m square shuttle run test (SSR), and a maximal treadmill test (MT) to exhaustion. Data were also obtained from knee flexion and extension isokinetic dynamometry at 60 degrees.s-1. Results. MSR performance correlated with the peak torque generated from both legs at r = 0.63 (P &lt; 0.001). The equivalent for SSR was significant at r = 0.44 (P &lt; 0.05), while MT demonstrated a non-significant positive correlation coefficient (r = 0.34, P &gt; 0.05). Stepwise regression analyses revealed that the inclusion of leg strength parameters increased the coefficient of determination by 9 % (P &lt; 0.001) and 4 % (P &lt; 0.05) in the MSR and SSR, respectively. The MT model was not significantly associated with any of the isokinetic indices studied. Conclusion. Although moderately significant, the present coefficients suggest that performance in the present field-based cardiorespiratory fitness tasks is affected to a certain extent by lower extremity muscular strength. The latter also demonstrates a positive relationship with laboratory-based performance.

For example, muscle hypertrophies during strength training and increases its oxidative capacity in response to endurance training. Conditions associated with disuse, however, are also accompanied by adaptations, of which atrophy and a slow-to-fast transition are most prominent. Fast and slow muscles respond differently to disuse. The different response of muscle to different models of disuse reveals that loading is most important, but that also activity level, neurotrophic factors, and ageing play a part in determining the mass, morphology, contractile properties, and fatigability of a muscle. Muscle loss during disuse is a result, at least in part, of apoptosis. Finally, skeletal muscle wasting and remodeling during ageing and chronic disorders, such as chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are not entirely attributable to disuse, but are also related to secondary consequences of the disease, most notably inflammation. Besides activating other pathways, we present evidence that inflammation during ageing and chronic disorders causes muscle wasting via alterations in abundance and/or activity of muscle specific transcription factors and induction of apoptosis, and that systemic inflammation rather than disuse is the primary cause of muscle wasting during aging and chronic disorders.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of plyometric or core training on injury, muscle damage, and training variables in marathon runners. Methods: This study was a randomized-controlled trial. 34 subjects, ages 18–23 (20.7 ± 1.3) following the same marathon training program, were allocated to one of three groups for a weekly training session: core, plyometric, or no additional training (control). Subjects kept a training log throughout training. Outcomes were assessed during the 8-week run-in (RI) and 13-week marathon training (MT) periods. The plyometric and core training group subjects were assessed pre- and post-marathon for creatine kinase (CK), a marker of muscle damage. Results: The plyometric group did not change in any training variables between RI and MT. The core group increased in days missed due to injury (p = 0.003) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) (p = 0.028). The control group increased in RPE (p = 0.010) and soreness (p = 0.010). The plyometric group had lower pre-marathon CK levels than the core group (81 ± 36 vs. 136 ± 59 U/L; p = 0.042). During MT, the plyometric group missed fewer days of training (plyometric: 1.7 ± 2.9; core: 4.2 ± 5.1; control: 4.5 ± 4.8) and missed fewer days due to injury (plyometric: 1.2 ± 2.6; core: 2.7 ± 5.1, control; 4.1 ± 4.9) but the differences were not significant. Conclusions: A weekly plyometric training session may be superior to core or no additional training in improving training variables of recreational marathon runners.

Strengthening the CORE has received increasing attention from sports medicine specialists after the 2000s, and strength training is the subject of recent research in competitive sports. However, there is still a lack of conceptual studies of protocols for training focused on soccer athletes. Objective: Verify a CORE strength training protocol based on the analysis of the CORE training concept, its main functions, and introductory practical examples. Methods: Literature data collection, experimental and statistical-mathematical methods, and theoretical analysis about CORE training focused on explosive strength performance in soccer players are used. The developed protocol experiments with 44 athletes, divided into experimental and control groups, by sex. Information is collected on goal shooting, 30-meter pass, balance, stability, and symmetry. Results: The group experienced better results in both sexes(P<0.05). Conclusion: The explosion strength indicators of the players were significantly improved. Whether male or female athletes, the higher the skill level, the stronger the CORE stability in players. Therefore, the CORE stability and strengthening in athletes promote a benefit in the technical level of soccer players.

Thirtyfour healthy adult females (21.1 ± 2.7 y) were randomly divided into four groups: control (C), traditional strength training (TS), traditional endurance training (TE), and low velocity training (LV). Workouts consisted of three exercises: leg press, back squat, and knee extension. Each subject was pre- and post-tested for 1 Repetition Maximum (1-RM), and relative muscular endurance (60% 1-RM). Pre- and post-training vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were also analyzed for fiber cross-sectional area (CSA). For each training session, TS trained at 6-10 RM (6-10 repetitions to failure) with 1-2 s concentric/1-2 s eccentric; TE trained at 20-30 RM (1-2 s concentric/1-2 s eccentric); and LV trained at 6-10 RM, with 10 s concentric/4 s eccentric. Both TE and LV trained at the same relative intensity (40-60% 1RM), whereas TS trained at 80-85% 1RM. Each training group attended a minimum of 16 out of 17 training sessions in which the exercises were performed to fatigue for each of 3 sets. For this investigation, the percent change in strength (%strength) was averaged across the three exercises, as was the percent change in number of repetitions (%reps) and volume (%vol) performed during the muscular endurance test (volume was calculated as load times repetitions performed). Significance was set at an alpha of 0.05. The %strength was significantly greater for TS compared to all other groups and also for LV as compared to C. The %vol was significantly greater for TS as compared to LV and C, and LV and TE as compared to C. The %reps was significantly greater for TE as compared to C. As previously reported, percent change in CSA for type I, IIa, and mean CSA was significantly greater for TS as compared to all other groups, and for type IIx, TS was significantly greater than C only. The %strength was significantly correlated with percent change in CSA for type I, IIa and mean CSA, %vol was correlated with percent change in CSA for type IIa and mean CSA, and there were no significant correlations between %reps and any percent change in CSA. Strength gains are correlated with increases in type I and IIa, as well as mean CSA. Changes in muscle endurance as found by changes in number of repetitions at a relative % 1-RM are not correlated with changes in CSA. However, when using volume instead of repetitions, muscle endurance is correlated to muscle fiber CSA changes. It appears that the higher load used with TS is associated with the highest percent increases in both strength and muscle fiber CSA, and is therefore the most beneficial training method of the three presented if considering these outcomes.

The subjects consisted of 45 male professional athletes (MMA fighters, Professional soccer players, and Rugby players) and 14 physically active males were subjects in this study. The subjects' training frequency was 6.1 ± 0.5 d·wk-1 and at least 540 min·wk-1 of moderate to high-intensity with training programs consisting of resistance exercise, aerobic training, and specific exercise to each sports modality. The subjects in the control group did not perform any specific exercises. All subjects performed 3 practices CMJ trials followed by 3 CMJ trials and 1 min rest between trials. All tests were performed on the force platform. Significantly (P<0.001) improved jump height was evident in the MMA fighters and professional soccer players (37.7 ± 7.4 cm and 41.6 ± 6.1 cm, respectively) in relation to the rugby and the control groups (30.4 ± 4.6 cm and 28.6 ± 3.6 cm, respectively). Pearson's analysis demonstrated that jump height was significantly correlated with push-off and landing phases in the MMA fighters, but not with the rugby athletes, the professional soccer players, and the control group. Soccer players and MMA fighters showed greater jump height than the Rugby players and the control subjects, with the fighters relying more on push off forces to achieve peak power output, while soccer players used other neuromuscular characteristics.

Observational studies have shown that physical activity leads to reduced recurrence and mortality rates by 20–40% in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. Despite existing evidence, a systematic care structure is still lacking. The primary aim of this study is to implement and evaluate an online training platform to strengthen physical performance and patient empowerment after cancer surgery. Methods: The evaluation will be conducted as a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial with three subgroups (colorectal-, breast-, and prostate cancer). Each group will include 100 patients (total 300 patients including dropouts; clinical stages T1–3 and/or N+; M0 after surgery intervention) and the primary endpoint (13% increase in the maximal oxygen consumption during exercise) will be examined. The intervention group will receive a 6-month home-based online training (2–3 times per week strength-endurance training using video presentations), bidirectional activity feedback information, online communication, and online counseling. The control group (usual care) will be advised lifestyle improvement. In-hospital testing will be performed before, during, and after the intervention. In addition to cardiopulmonary capacity, tumor specific diagnostics (liquid biopsy, depression and fatigue assessment, metabolic and endothelial screening) will be applied. Discussion: Due to the increasing incidence of cancer, associated with considerable mortality, morbidity and impaired quality of life, there is an imperative requirement for improved cancer care, of which structured physical training may become an integral component.

Twelve recreationally trained men (age, 23.2 ± 5.6 years; body mass, 84.3 ± 9.3 kg; body height, 178.9 ± 4.5 cm; and BMI, 26.3 ± 2.3 kg·m2) volunteered to participate in this study. All subjects were randomly assigned to four experimental protocols (crossover): (a) aerobic training at 60% of VO2max, (b) aerobic training at 80% of VO2max, (c) a resistance exercise (RE) session with a bi-set protocol, and (d) an RE session with a multiple sets protocol. Blood samples were collected before, immediately after and 24 hours following the experimental protocols. After 24 hours, there was a significant increase in CK for the 80% of VO2max protocol vs. the bi-set RE session (p = 0.016). Immediately after the protocols, we observed a significant increase in LDH among certain groups compared to others, as follows: multiple sets RE session vs. 60% of VO2max, bi-set RE session vs. 60% of VO2max, multiple sets RE session vs. 80% of VO2max, and bi-set RE session vs. 80% of VO2max (p = 0.008, p = 0.013; p = 0.002, p = 0.004, respectively). In conclusion, aerobic exercise performed at 80% of VO2max appears to elevate plasma CK levels more than bi-set RE sessions. However, the bi-set and multiple sets RE sessions appeared to trigger greater levels of blood LDH compared to aerobic protocols performed at 60% and 80% of VO2max.

This article aimed to analyze the acute and chronic effects of CrossFit® and to assess the relevance of using the concurrent training methodology. The findings show that CrossFit® is an intense form of exercise that affects the function of the endocrine, immune, and central nervous systems. It also has potential in the development of strength and endurance parameters. These conclusions were compared with relevant concurrent training studies. Although the CrossFit® interventions (workouts of the day) have much in common with concurrent training, methodological recommendations can only be partially transferred. The approach for training and athlete development must be based on the originality of this sport.

As the tasks required of officers generally do not change with advancing age, it is important to understand how physical performance in tests that assess job-specific characteristics may be altered. Retrospective analysis of performance test data of 383 officers (362 men and 21 women) was conducted. The tests included the following: sit-and-reach to determine hamstring and lower back flexibility; maximal push-up and sit-up repetitions in 60 seconds to measure muscle endurance; vertical jump (VJ) to assess lower- body power; and 2.4-km run to ascertain aerobic capacity. Data were stratified by age into 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59 year groups, and analyzed by sex. A 1-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post hoc test was used to calculate the differences between the groups. Considering the male subjects, the 40-49 and 50-59 year groups performed poorer in the VJ, sit-up test, and 2.4-km run compared with the 20-29 year group (p < 0.001-0.045). For the female subjects, the 20-29 year group was superior to the 30-39 (p = 0.013) and 40-49 (p = 0.025) year groups in the push-up test. To ensure that an older officer can successfully complete occupation-specific tasks, lower-body power, abdominal strength, and aerobic training should be completed. Female officers should also attempt to maintain relative upper-body strength. Practitioners must attempt to design training programs that fit within the context of the occupational demands, and potentially using a nontraditional training design as law enforcement officers may not have the time to follow a traditional periodization model.

In EAs, the absolute values of type I and type II MF CSAs in the muscles taxed most (6438 ± 1074 and 7296 ± 1242 µm2) were higher (p < 0.05) than in the muscles taxed less (5310 ± 1200 and 5800 ± 1100 µm2). Type I MF CSA of the muscles taxed most in EAs was higher than in SAs and SSAs (6438 ± 1074, 5715 ± 1090, and 5690 ± 1010 µm2; p < 0.05). Type II MF CSA of the muscles taxed most in EAs was lower than in SAs (7296 ± 1242 and 8712 ± 1520 µm2; p < 0.05) and much the same as in SSAs (6820 ± 1200 µm2; p < 0.05). When type II MF CSA of the muscles taxed most was normalized to body weight, the value in EAs was higher than in SSAs (103.1 ± 20 and 84.0 ± 18 µm2/kg, p < 0.05) and much the same as in SAs (97.3 ± 18 µm2/kg, p > 0.05). Both an increase in oxidative capacity and MF hypertrophy were assumed to play a role in muscle adaptation to long-term training in EAs. The functional load on the muscles in the main competitive exercise is necessary to consider when comparing CSA in athletes of different specializations.

Levy ., (1986) suggested that less injury may occur within this sport than in its component disciplines. Massimino ., (1988) proposed the opposite. Objective To determine whether swim, cycle and or run training exert a cumulative stress effect on triathlon overuse injury (OU) risk. Design Seven month prospective longitudinal training diary based survey, from the endurance base period up to World Championships. Setting British Olympic distance specialists. Participants Top 50 finishers at their non-drafting National Championships in the year of, or year prior to, the study. Assessment of risk factors Both absolute (ie, duration) and derived training variables were assessed. Derived variables included both training that was weighted for each of five intensity levels it comprised, and combined training for more than one discipline. Log values (% difference from the previous week) and (difference from the previous week) for training variables for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks prior to injury were used. Main outcome measurements ‘New OU’ was used as the dependant variable in a binary logistic regression analysis, involving combinations of 1–4 training related variables. Anatomical location, discipline(s) that OU was attributed to (on first and subsequent occurrence(s), and performance decrement (PD) were also assessed. Results Return rates were 43, 38, 33, 26, 21, 14 and 11 for each consecutive month. 60% of athletes reported OU with concomitant PD at least once. New OU was associated with an increase in the log of combined weighted cycle and run training in levels 3, 4 and 5 two weeks prior to onset (p<0.05). Conclusion The extent to which cycle and run training have a cumulative effect on triathlon injury risk deserves further investigation.

J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1738–1748, 2022—The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of daily undulating periodization (DUP) and nonperiodized training (NPT) programs on maximal muscle strength, body composition, aerobic capacity, muscle power, and immune markers in people living with HIV (PLWHIV). A total of 41 PLWHIV were randomly assigned to control (CON [ n = 15]), DUP (n = 13), and NPT (n = 13) groups. The DUP and NPT groups performed combined training 3 times a week on nonconsecutive days during 12 weeks, whereas the CON group was asked to maintain their current level of activity. After the 12-week training program, DUP produced greater gains in muscle strength (except for bench press), V̇ o 2peak, and muscle power than NPT (p < 0.05). Compared to CON, the training groups showed significantly (p < 0.05) increased muscle strength (DUP = 31.0 ± 13.9 kg; NPT = 17.7 ± 9.2 kg; CON = −0.3 ± 1.5 kg), fat-free mass (DUP = 1.9 ± 1.5 kg; NPT = 1.4 ± 1.9 kg; CON = −0.1 ± 1.2 kg), and metabolic equivalent (DUP = 2.3 ± 1.3; NPT = 1.8 ± 1.9), and decreased body fat mass (DUP = −2.1 ± 1.6 kg; NPT = −1.4 ± 1.5 kg; CON = 0.1 ± 0.2) and functional aerobic impairment (DUP = −35.9 ± 17.0%; NPT = −25.8 ± 22.0%; CON = 0.8 ± 3.0%). There was an increase in TCD4+ cells only in the DUP group (p < 0.05). The training effect generally provided a positive correlation between change in leg press strength (r = 0.393, p < 0.05), triceps pulley strength (r = 0.417, p < 0.05), lat pull-down strength (r = 0.459, p < 0.05), and muscle power (r = 0.324, p < 0.05) with changing CD4 + lymphocyte count.

The stimulus for an increase in strength is the development of tension in the elastic elements of the muscle. Its magnitude decreases from dynamic-excentric to static, isokinetic and dynamic-concentric contractions. Except for static contractions, where the tension development can be constant, it normally depends on joint angles and muscle length. Maximum strength has no linear correlation to the cross-sectional muscle area. During strength training, for example, maximum strength increases more than the cross-sectional area. Static strength training is indicated for the rehabilitation of atrophic muscles and for the stabilization of body postures against gravity. Dynamic-concentric training does not only improve muscle strength, but also its contraction velocity and coordination. Dynamic-excentric training with additional development of tension leads to a pronounced increase of strength and to an enhancement of strength endurance. This training, however, involves an increased danger of injuries and muscle-soreness. The advantages of isokinetic training result from its methodical application. Concerning the strength increase, no significant differences to dynamic-concentric training can be observed.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH233270&site=ehost-live"

There are no genderrelated differences in this entity. An enlargement of the heart through endurance training is nevertheless possible in adolescence and in athletes of middle or advanced age. However, the constellation of an athlete's heart is much more uncommon than generally supposed. Therefore, not every high skilled athlete develops an athlete's heart at all. The adaptations in cardiac dimensions, with the appearance of left ventricular excentric hypertrophy, are only moderate. A left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and a wall thickness of 60 mm and 13 mm respectively are rarely exceeded. Resistance training (without anabolic supplements) does not lead to a relevant increase of ventricular wall thickness. ECG changes are common, however, they rarely imply a pathological finding. After cessation of regular training, the regression of the physiological adaptations of an athlete's heart is incomplete, frequently. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are not increased in individuals with an athlete's heart.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, randomised, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Sedentary older adults (n = 115) with untreated prehypertension or mild hypertension. INTERVENTION: Six-month supervised aerobic and strength training. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Systolic BP (SBP) was assessed at rest and during each stage of a maximal graded exercise test (GXT) that determined VO2peak. General and regional fatness was assessed by anthropometry, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and MRI. BP changes were calculated for each GXT stage, and multivariate regression models were used to describe the association of changes in exercise BP with changes in fitness and fatness. RESULTS: After training, exercisers versus controls had significantly increased VO2peak and significantly lower measures of general and regional fatness. Also, stage-specific SBP was significantly lower at stage 3 (–9.4 vs –1.6 mm Hg, p = 0.03) and stage 4 (–7.9 vs –1.2 mm Hg, p = 0.03). Pooled regression analysis across all stages showed that exercisers had a 7.1 mm Hg reduction in SBP, but this reduction fell short of statistical significance (p = 0.12) compared with controls. A 1.0 ml/kg/min increase in VO2peak and a 1.0 cm decrease in waist circumference independently predicted a 1.0 mm Hg decrease in exercise SBP (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased exercise SBP was independently associated with decreased waist circumference, a marker of abdominal obesity and increased fitness. These findings suggest that exercise training improves multiple factors that have an independent influence on SBP.

To current knowledge, no method exists to automatically detect a series of features in a repetition training session using one three-dimensional accelerometer. In this study, a specific algorithm was used to detect the number of repetitions and different time features. Features determined by the acceleration algorithm were compared to a reference system using a linear wire encoder to detect movements. A total of 50 healthy participants were randomly assigned to three different groups (maximal strength, hypertrophy, and muscular endurance) and executed three different resistance-training exercises (bench press, leg press, and trunk flexion). Results of both measurement systems were compared for agreement using Bland–Altman plots, regarding repetition numbers, TUT (time under tension) in concentric, eccentric, and isometric contraction forms and total TUT (sum of all contraction forms) as well as break between repetitions. Both methods showed high agreement in repetition count (mean error − 0.2 ± 0.6 repetitions). Time features were detected with less agreement, with 10.0% disagreement for TUT in first phase, 1.1% disagreement for second phase, and 56% disagreement in isometric contraction. However, it was possible to detect a series of time-based movement features, enhancing the possibility to objectively record different parameters of a resistance training session. This will improve research in resistance training and also bring advantages in the training process for coach and athlete.

We investigated 129 persons from the cantons of Zurich and Aargau: 72 men with a mean age of 71 (plus/minus 5) years, and 57 women with a mean age of 66 (plus/minus 6) years. All subjects answered questions on sports activity and life-style and carried out a fitness-test. Participants in three different types of exercise were investigated: joggers (n = 34), polysportive course (n = 19), indoor gymnastics (n = 76). As a control group, all residents of the community of Rupperswil (Aargau) aged 62 to 70 years were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire. The elderly exercising women and men were physically more active than the control group (p = 0.002); this difference was more prominent among women (p = 0.006) than men. Compared to the control group, the elderly exercisers had a significantly lower body mass index (men p = 0.005; women p = 0.003), and they rated their subjective health significantly better. The more active the elderly exercisers were, the better was their physical capacity in the fitness-test. Maximal oxygen uptake, estimated with a walking-test, and muscular endurance strength of the hip flexors showed a highly significant association (p is less than 0.01) with the level of endurance training; hand grip strength and trunk mobility were correspondingly correlated with the volume of fitness training and conditioning exercises. Among the elderly exercisers, men showed significantly better values of endurance capacity and strength parameters than women, and, women had a significantly better trunk mobility than men. Multivariate regression analyses confirmed the highly significant dependence of the tested fitness parameters on life-style habits and sociodemographic factors. Endurance training and sports activity (standardized regression coefficient 0.52), sex (0.48), relative weight (-0.31) and age (-0.25) were the most important predictors in a statistical model, which explained 64 percent of variance in estimated aerobic capacity. Analogous regression models explained 60 percent of variance in hand grip strength and 27 percent of variance in trunk mobility. This cross-sectional study confirms that elderly exercisers are a segment of the population aged 60 and more that is physically more active, is less often overweight and has a better self-rated health. The documented high level of physical fitness of these active elderly is likely to be determined substantially by their exercise and life-style habits.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH418273&site=ehost-live"

The oxygen uptake at the second ventilatory threshold ( VO2 VT2) and at the end of exercise ( VO2max), maximum voluntary contraction force (MVC) of knee extensors and some metabolic indexes, i.e., insulin sensitivity, blood lipid profile, inflammatory cytokines, and endothelial function, were evaluated at baseline and after the training and detraining periods. The training program induced significant improvements in VO2 VT2 (16%, p < 0.05), VO2max (14%, p < 0.05), MVC (6.5%, p < 0.05), insulin sensitivity (16%, p < 0.05), and endothelial function ( p < 0.05) but induced no significant change in lipid profile and inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, VO2 VT2 and VO2max (mL·min-1·kg-1) scores remained significantly above pretraining values after the 8-week detraining period. However, the detraining period reversed MVC values, the insulin sensitivity and endothelial function to baseline levels. To conclude, the 8-week detraining partially reversed the major components of aerobic fitness but totally abolished the gains in muscle strength and some metabolic indexes after a 16-week multicomponent training program in older men. Taken as a whole, the results of this study emphasize the importance of exercise prescriptions for older subjects and the need not to interrupt exercise-training over a prolonged period.

Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis study was to compare the effect of concurrent resistance and endurance training with that of resistance training only on the development of maximal dynamic strength in untrained, moderately trained, and trained individuals. Methods: On the basis of the predetermined criteria, 27 studies that compared effects between concurrent and resistance training only on lower-body 1-repetition maximum (1RM) strength were included. The effect size (ES), calculated as the standardised difference in mean, was extracted from each study, pooled, and analysed with a random-effects model. Results: The 1RM for leg press and squat exercises was negatively affected by concurrent training in trained individuals (ES = – 0.35, p < 0.01), but not in moderately trained (– 0.20, p = 0.08) or untrained individuals (ES = 0.03, p = 0.87) as compared to resistance training only. A subgroup analysis revealed that the negative effect observed in trained individuals occurred only when resistance and endurance training were conducted within the same training session (ES same session = – 0.66, p < 0.01 vs. ES different sessions = – 0.10, p = 0.55). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the novel and quantifiable effects of training status on lower-body strength development and shows that the addition of endurance training to a resistance training programme may have a negative impact on lower-body strength development in trained, but not in moderately trained or untrained individuals. This impairment seems to be more pronounced when training is performed within the same session than in different sessions. Trained individuals should therefore consider separating endurance from resistance training during periods where the development of dynamic maximal strength is prioritised.

All groups increased BFlh pennation angle (CONC: 18% [9%], RT: 14% [8%], and END: 18% [10%]). Thickness of the BFlh increased postintervention by 7% (6%) (P =.002) and 7% (7%) (P =.003) in the CONC and RT groups, respectively, but not in the END group (0% [3%], P =.994). Both the CONC and RT groups significantly increased by 27% (11%) (P <.001) and 33% (12%) (P <.001) in 3-lift totals following the intervention, with no changes in the END cohort (6% [6%], P =.166). No significant differences were found for total body (CONC: 4% [2%], RT: 4% [2%], and END: 3% [2%]) and leg (CONC: 5% [3%], RT: 6% [3%], and END: 5% [3%]) fat-free mass. Conclusions: Twelve weeks of RT, END, or CONC significantly modified BFlh architecture. This study suggests that conventional resistance training may dampen BFlh fascicle shortening from cycling training while increasing strength simultaneously in concurrent training. Furthermore, the inclusion of a cycle endurance training stimulus may result in alterations to hamstring architecture that increase the risk of future injury. Therefore, the incorporation of endurance cycling training within concurrent training paradigms should be reevaluated when trying to modulate injury risk.

Forty-two physically active men were matched and then randomly assigned to either a training to failure (RF; n = 14), nonfailure (NRF; n = 15), or control groups (C; n = 13). Muscular and power testing and blood draws to determine basal hormonal concentrations were conducted before the initiation of training (TO), after 6 wk of training (T1), after 11 wk of training (T2), and after 16 wk of training (T3). Both RF and NRF resulted in similar gains in 1-repetition maximum bench press (23 and 23%) and parallel squat (22 and 23%), muscle power output of the arm (27 and 28%) and leg extensor muscles (26 and 29%), and maximal number of repetitions performed during parallel squat (66 and 69%). RF group experienced larger gains in the maximal number of repetitions performed during the bench press. The peaking phase (T2 to T3) after NRF resulted in larger gains in muscle power output of the lower extremities, whereas after RF it resulted in larger gains in the maximal number of repetitions performed during the bench press. Strength training leading to RF resulted in reductions in resting concentrations of IGF-1 and elevations in IGFBP-3, whereas NRF resulted in reduced resting cortisol concentrations and an elevation in resting serum total testosterone concentration. This investigation demonstrated a potential beneficial stimulus of NRF for improving strength and power, especially during the subsequent peaking training period, whereas performing sets to failure resulted in greater gains in local muscular endurance. Elevation in IGFBP-3 after resistance training may have been compensatory to accommodate the reduction in IGF-1 to preserve IGF availability.

Neither endurance nor sprint training alter skeletal muscle perfusion at rest but can result in an increase in muscle blood flow during the anticipation of exercise. The magnitude of the anticipatory increases in muscle blood flow is dependent on the intensity and duration of the prior training bouts and results from elevations in mean arterial pressure and decreases in vascular resistance in skeletal muscle. The decrements in skeletal muscle vascular resistance appear to be mediated through increases in muscle sympathetic cholinergic nerve activity or decreases in muscle sympathetic adrenergic nerve activity. During submaximal exercise, total muscle blood flow is either unchanged or slightly lower. However, a redistribution of muscle blood flow may occur following aerobic training, resulting in an enhanced perfusion of high-oxidative skeletal muscles and less flow going to low-oxidative muscles. The increased perfusion of the high-oxidative muscles may result from various factors including: a) increased recruitment of high-oxidative motor units, b) increased local release of metabolic vasodilator substances, c) qualitative changes in the metabolic substances released, d) decreased muscle sympathetic nerve activity, e) diminished sensitivity of the arterial vasculature to norepinephrine or other vasoconstrictor agents, f) enhanced endothelium-mediated dilation in the resistance vasculature, and g) an increased effectiveness of the skeletal muscle pump. Conversely, the decreases in blood flow to low-oxidative muscles may result from an enhanced autoregulatory responsiveness of the resistance vasculature. Endurance and sprint training increase muscle perfusion during exercise at VO2max; this primarily appears to be the result of an enhanced pumping capacity of the heart to increase in maximal cardiac output. Many of the training-induced alterations in muscle blood flow and vascular structure are localized in the muscles that are most active during the training bouts. Therefore, differences in muscle recruitment patterns that occur with low-intensity endurance exercise and high-intensity sprint exercise may account for differences observed between these two training regimens.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH461500&site=ehost-live"

To investigate this, human subjects were divided into endurance, strength, and non-exercise control groups. Data were obtained before and during post-exercise recovery from single-bout exercise, conducted with an exercise mode to which the exercise subjects were accustomed through 10 weeks of prior training. Blood and muscle samples were analyzed for plasma substrates and hormones and for muscle markers of AMPK and Akt- mTORC1 protein signaling. Increases in plasma glucose, insulin, growth hormone ( GH), and insulin-like growth factor ( IGF)-1, and in phosphorylated muscle phospho- Akt substrate ( PAS) of 160 kDa, mTOR, 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase, eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E, and glycogen synthase kinase 3α were observed after strength exercise. Increased phosphorylation of AMPK, histone deacetylase5 ( HDAC5), cAMP response element-binding protein, and acetyl- CoA carboxylase ( ACC) was observed after endurance exercise, but not differently from after strength exercise. No changes in protein phosphorylation were observed in non-exercise controls. Endurance training produced an increase in maximal oxygen uptake and a decrease in submaximal exercise heart rate, while strength training produced increases in muscle cross-sectional area and strength. No changes in basal levels of signaling proteins were observed in response to training. The results support that in training-accustomed individuals, mTORC1 signaling is preferentially activated after hypertrophy-inducing exercise, while AMPK signaling is less specific for differentiated exercise.

Whereas the repetition of maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) induces neuromuscular fatigue, the effect of maximal imagined contractions (MIC) on neuromuscular fatigue remains unknown. Here, we investigated neuromuscular alterations after a mental training session including MIC, a physical training session including MVC, and a combined training session including both MIC and MVC of the elbow flexor muscles. Methods: Ten participants performed 80 MIC (duty cycle, 5-s MIC and 10-s rest), 80 MVC (identical duty cycle), or 80 MVC and 80 MIC (5-s MVC, 2-s rest, 5-s MIC, and 3-s rest) in three separate sessions. MVC torque was assessed five times over the course of the training and 10 min after the end of the training in the three protocols. Central activation ratio (CARc), reflecting central fatigue, and corticospinal excitability, at rest and during MIC, were estimated using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Results: Both the physical training and the combined training induced an approximately 40% drop of MVC torque, accompanied with an approximately 10% decrease of CARc without significant difference between the two sessions. On the contrary, the repetition of MIC did not reduce maximal force production capacity and did not alter CARc. Corticospinal excitability was always facilitated during MIC compared with that during rest, ensuring that the participants imagined the desired movement. Conclusions: These results suggested that one session of mental training alone or combined with physical training do not induce (additional) neuromuscular fatigue despite the repetitive activation of the corticospinal track. Motor imagery may be added to physical practice to increase the total workload without exacerbating neuromuscular fatigue.

The Downs and Black checklist was used for the assessment of methodological quality of the included studies. A random-effects meta-analysis was employed. In total, three analyses were performed: (1) for whole-muscle knee extensor data; (2) for type I fiber cross-sectional area; and (3) for type II fiber cross-sectional area.Results: The final number of included studies in the present review is 21. All studies were of good or moderate methodological quality. The meta-analysis for whole-muscle hypertrophy resulted in a significant pooled difference (p < 0.001) in responses between the aerobic training and resistance training interventions. The pooled Hedge's g, favoring resistance over aerobic training, was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.41-90; I2 = 0%). The meta-analysis for type I fiber cross-sectional area data resulted in a significant pooled difference (p < 0.001) between the aerobic training and resistance training groups. The pooled Hedge's g, favoring resistance training over aerobic training, was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.44-1.54; I2 = 24%). The meta-analysis of type II fiber cross-sectional area data resulted in a significant pooled difference (p < 0.001) between the aerobic training and resistance training groups. The pooled Hedge's g, favoring resistance training over aerobic training, was 1.44 (95% confidence interval 0.93-1.95; I2 = 8%).Conclusions: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that single-mode aerobic training does not promote the same skeletal muscle hypertrophy as resistance training. This finding was consistent with measurements of muscle hypertrophy both at the whole-muscle and myofiber levels. While these results are specific to the knee extensor musculature, it can be hypothesized that similar results would be seen for other muscle groups as well.

The participants were divided into two groups: an experimental group (eight boys and four girls) and a control group (six boys and five girls). Apart from normal practice sessions (six training units per week of 1 h and 30 min per day), the experimental group underwent eight weeks (two sessions per week) of strength training. The principal strength exercises were the bench press, the leg extension, and two power exercises such as countermovement jump and medicine ball throwing. Immediately following this strength training program, all the swimmers undertook a 6 week detraining period, maintaining the normal swimming program, without any strength training. Swimming (25 m and 50 m performances, and hydrodynamic drag values), and strength (bench press and leg extension) and power (throwing medicine ball and countermovement jump) performances were tested in three moments: (i) before the experimental period, (ii) after eight weeks of combined strength and swimming training, and (iii) after the six weeks of detraining period. Both experimental and control groups were evaluated. A combined strength and aerobic swimming training allow dry land strength developments in young swimmers. The main data can not clearly state that strength training allowed an enhancement in swimming performance, although a tendency to improve sprint performance due to strength training was noticed. The detraining period showed that, although strength parameters remained stable, swimming performance still improved.

In addition, the examination of combined core-strengthening and endurance running and the use of strength training to protect endurance runners from musculoskeletal running injuries. The authors' complied with PRIMSA guidelines. The outcome interest was concurrent strength training and endurance running, exposure was endurance runners. Seven electronic databases were searched for publications meeting the following inclusion criteria; concomitant strength training and endurance running ranging from 2003-2013, with 48 relevant publications being identified. These were assessed for quality resulting in 25 English published articles; however 15 intervention and two review studies were used. Concurrent strength training and endurance running improves the RE of endurance runners, without impacting on their VO2max and LT. Combined core strength training and running had contradictory findings regarding the benefits for enhanced running performance. The use of strength training as a protective measure against musculoskeletal running injuries has shown to be a worthwhile intervention. It is recommended that future prospective randomized controlled studies using large samples, longer interventions, and completion times of 10km, 21.1km and 42.2km be used to determine the success of concurrent strength and endurance training.

However, no study has addressed the influence of intensity distribution on the effectiveness of concurrent training (CT). The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of 2 CT programs with different training intensity distribution and externally equated loads on physical fitness. Thirty-one sport science students volunteered and were evaluated for resting heart rate variability (HRV), countermovement jump, bench press, half squat, and maximum aerobic speed (MAS). All were randomly distributed into either a traditional-based training group (TT; n = 11 ; 65-75% of MAS, combined with 10-12 repetition maximum [RM]), polarized training group (PT; n = 10; 35-40% and 1 20% of MAS, combined with 5RM and 15RM), or control group (CG; n = 10). After 8 weeks of training (3 days week-1), TT and PT exhibited similar improvements in MAS, bench press, and half squat performances. No differences were observed between TT and PT groups for perceived loads. There were no changes in HRV for any group, although TT exhibited a reduction in resting heart rate. Compared with other groups, the PT group maintained jump capacity with an increment in body mass and body mass index without changes in body fatness. In conclusion, PT induced similar improvements in physical fitness of physically active individuals when compared with TT. However, PT produced a lower interference for jumping capacity despite an increment in body mass, whereas TT induced greater bradycardia. Extended studies with different intensity distributions should be conducted to better determine the dose-response of CT in various populations.

Postpubertal adolescents ( N = 304) aged 14-18 years with obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th percentile) or overweight (BMI ≥ 85th percentile + additional diabetes risk factor(s)) were randomized to 4 groups for 22 weeks: Aerobic exercise training, Resistance exercise training, Combined aerobic and resistance exercise training, or Control. All participants received dietary counselling targeting a daily energy deficit of 250 kcal. RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry and body composition by magnetic resonance imaging. There was no significant change in RMR in any group, in spite of significant within-group increases in fat-free mass in the Aerobic, Resistance, and Combined exercise training groups. RMR at baseline and 6 months were Aerobic: 1972 ± 38 and 1990 ± 41; Resistance: 2024 ± 37 and 1992 ± 41; Combined: 2023 ± 38 and 1995 ± 38; Control: 2075 ± 38 and 2073 ± 39 kcal/day ( p > 0.05). There were no between-group differences in RMR after adjustment for total body weight or fat-free mass between groups over time. Per-protocol analyses including only participants with ≥70% adherence, and analyses stratified by sex, also showed no within- or between-group differences in RMR. In conclusion, despite an increase in fat-free mass in all exercise groups, 6 months of aerobic, resistance, or combined training with modest dietary restriction did not increase RMR compared with diet only in adolescents with obesity.

Twenty-two elite rowers were assigned to (1) rowing (n = 10, 250–270 km · week−1) or (2) rowing (n = 12, 190–210 km · week−1) plus four weight-training sessions each week. Pre and post mean and standardized effect-size (ES) differences in aerobic condition (watts at 4 mmol · L−1) and strength (isometric pull, N), prone bench-pull (6-repetition maximum, 6-RM), 5- and 30-repetition leg-press and 60-repetition seated-arm-pull (J, performed on a dynamometer) normalized by body mass and log-transformed were analysed, after adjusting for gender. The standardized differences between groups were trivial for aerobic condition (ES [±90% CI] = 0.15; ±0.28, P = 0.37) and prone bench-pull (ES = 0.27; ±0.33, P = 0.18), although a moderate positive benefit in favour of rowing only was observed for the seated-arm-pull (ES = 0.42; ±0.4, P = 0.08). Only the weight-training group improved isometric pull (12.4 ± 8.9%, P < 0.01), 5-repetition (4.0 ± 5.7%, P < 0.01) and 30-repetition (2.4 ± 5.4%, P < 0.01) leg-press. In conclusion, while gains in aerobic condition and upper-body strength were comparable to extensive endurance rowing, weight-training led to moderately greater lower-body muscular-endurance and strength gains.

"DOES RESISTANCE TRAINING IMPROVE RUNNING ECONOMY AND DISTANCE RUNNING PERFORMANCE? : LITERATURE REVIEW AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS.","Larisova, Veronika","Journal of Australian Strength & Conditioning",="18357644",,="20140301","22","1","56","7","95264192",,,"Article","RESISTANCE training; LONG-distance running; MARATHON running; SPORTS; RESEARCH",,"Distance running performance is thought to be dependent predominantly on three factors: maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), lactate threshold (LT), and running economy (RE). VO2max typically reaches a peak value for an athlete relatively fast with training. Further improvements in endurance performance that depend on physiological adaptations require other changes, such as changes in running economy. Improvements in VO2max, LT and RE are predominantly achieved through endurance training (ET). However, recent research shows that anaerobic factors may also play an important role in distance running performance leading to theories that resistance training (RT) may lead to enhanced running performance via improved RE. The purpose of this article was to review; i) the current research on resistance training aiming at enhancing distance running performance ii) the mechanisms by which strength training enhances distance running performance and iii) the evidence for the best methods and programming of strength training to enhance determinants of distance running performance. The aim of the review is to provide practical recommendations for strength and conditioning coaches in planning resistance training to supplement a distance running program. Conclusion: Research indicates that resistance training, when supplementing individualized endurance training, leads to improvements in running economy and distance running performance at lower volumes of endurance training, with no significant changes in VO2max or body mass.

Despite its popularity, there are very few studies on the health benefits of TKD, therefore this article attempts to pull together the existing strands of relevant research. Aim: This paper aimed to review the effects of TKD training on physical fitness. Methods: A search of literature on both electronic and printed media was performed and 23 papers with relevance to the topic were included and critically reviewed. The main outcomes examined were anaerobic and aerobic fitness, body composition, muscle strength, endurance, power and flexibility. Results: There is no conclusive evidence in the literature that TKD practice can improve anaerobic fitness or muscle strength. However, TKD training may have some benefits in aerobic capacity, body composition (fat loss) and flexibility. Conclusion: Physiotherapists or fitness instructors may consider recommending TKD to their clients as a beneficial form of exercise to promote aerobic fitness and flexibility.

Therefore, concurrent training of both muscular strength and aerobic endurance is often used in soccer. Concurrent training, however, has been proposed to cause an interference effect between aerobic training and resistance training. Aim: The aim of this study was to review recent research on concurrent training practices in soccer, with a particular focus on the duration of the training program. Methods: Database SportDiscus was searched for journal articles published within the last 15 years with ""concurrent training"", and ""soccer"" or ""football"" as the search terms. The search yielded 380 articles, which were subsequently reviewed. Inclusion criteria for the review included programs of greater than 5 weeks duration, participants over 16 years of age and comparison of different training methods. Results: Six articles addressed all of the selection criteria and were included in this review. Performance measures included the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (YYIRT 1), maximal aerobic speed (MAS), 30m-sprint and one-repetition maximum squat (1RM). All six studies showed improvements in performance irrespective of the concurrent training protocol used. Furthermore, concurrent protocols demonstrated greater improvements than soccer only programs. Study duration varied between 6 to 16 weeks. Greater performance improvements were associated with longer training programs (> 8weeks), compared with shorter duration programs. Discussion: This review showed that concurrent training results in improved strength, aerobic performance and sprint performance in soccer players. It was also shown that when using concurrent training it is important to use programs lasting longer than eight weeks in duration in order to maximise performance gains. Future research should investigate the different training modalities used in concurrent training and the duration of the overall concurrent training program in soccer.

Subjects were 14 healthy, sedentary women, 19-45 years of age (mean +/- SD age, 32.7 +/- 8.9 years), randomized to either the SS or TR training protocols and trained 3 times per week for 10 weeks. Measurements were taken both before and after training, which included a maximal incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer, body composition, and 1 repetition maximum (1RM) tests on 8 Nautilus machines. Both groups increased their strength significantly on all 8 exercises, whereas the TR group increased significantly more than the SS group on bench press (34 % vs. 11 %), torso arm (anterior lateral pull-down) (27 % vs. 12 %), leg press (33 % vs. 7 %), leg extension (56 % vs. 24 %), and leg curl (40 % vs. 15 %). Thus, the TR group's improvement in total exercise weight lifted was significantly greater than that of the SS group after testing (39 % vs. 15 %). Exercise duration on the cycle ergometer and work rate significantly improved for both groups, but there was no group-by-training interaction. No significant differences were found for body composition or additional aerobic variables measured. Both strength training protocols produced a significant improvement in strength during a 10-week training period, but the TR protocol produced better gains in the absence of changes in percentage of body fat, body mass index, lean body mass, and body weight. In addition, strength training alone did not improve VO2max, yet short-term endurance increased.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-790528&site=ehost-live"

Individuals were randomly organized into two groups: resistance training group (RG: Age=21.3±2.3 years; Body Mass=66.8±1.9 kg; Height=172.0±2.3 cm; Fat Mass=10.8±1.1%) and strength training group (SG: Age=20.9±1.2 years; Body Mass=69.8±1.3 kg; Height=172.8±3.9 cm, Fat Mass=11.4±0.6%) who performed a strength protocol during 9 weeks (2 days/week). No significant differences were observed at the end of the nine weeks training. Both groups improved significantly their performance in the medium and long distance races, strength, resistance strength and their aerobic capacity (VO2 max). Few changes were appreciable in the rest of the evaluated tests (60 and 300 meters). The greatest benefits were observed in the 2000 meters race. These improvements were detected from the first mesocycle and were especially evident at the end of the nine weeks. However, no significant differences were detected between groups (6.5±3.7 vs. 3.7±2.1 ml/kg/min; F=0.534; CI95%= -0.198, 5.932; p=0.65; ES=0.434).

The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of a physical exercise intervention, delivered face-to-face versus prescription through a mobile application. Twenty three participants (55-73 years old) were included in the 10-week intervention. Participants were allocated to the training group (n=16) or mobile group (n=7). The training group received 20 sessions (70-80 minutes per day) of physical exercise and were assigned to aerobic and resistance training (two sessions/per week). Intervention content was the same in the mobile group; only the delivery mode differed by means of a mobile application. We measured mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, percentage of muscle mass and body fat, balance, waist circumference, strength and aerobic capacity before and after 10 weeks of exercise intervention. The training group obtained improvements in mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate after exercise and aerobic capacity (p< .001, p< .001, p=.001, p=.003, p=.004, respectively). There were no significant changes in the mobile group. The results suggest that face-to-face exercise is more effective than prescribed using mobile applications. Future studies involving larger sample sizes should confirm or refute these findings. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=114785081&site=ehost-live"

The overall quality of the included studies was moderate (AMSTAR-2). EAFC showed greater improvements compared to EA on aerobic capacity, body composition and muscle strength in adult patients (mean age range: 45-73 years) with EAC. This review adds additional evidence that EAFC presents clinically significant improvements in aerobic capacity and muscular strength compared to EA. More studies are needed to establish consistent conclusions about the effects of EAFC compared to EA on quality of life. In addition, more studies are needed to analyze different protocols of the EAFC and to establish their most efficient prescription in CR of this population.

To do this, fourteen U-13 soccer players were randomized into two groups: Concurrent strength and specific soccer training (CT) and control group (CG), which only undergo their soccer training and competition routine. Plus to the CG training routine, the EC group implemented two strength training sessions per week (3 sets of 10 repetitions in 3 lower body exercises) with an intensity or level of effort that would allowed them to perform 16 repetitions (60% 1RM approx.) Before starting the program (T0) and immediately after the conclusion of the 4 weeks of the treatment (T1), subjects performed the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery test Level I (YYRI1) to estimate the aerobic power and an acceleration of 20m test with photoelectrical cells. Neither cardiorespiratory endurance assessed by the YYRI1 nor the acceleration capacity showed significant changes in either of the two groups (p > 0.05). The present results indicate that 4 weeks of concurrent muscle strength training with a low-moderate intensity and volume, and soccer-specific training are not sufficient stimuli to achieve positive adaptations in the physical fitness markers of young soccer players.

However, exercising to the point of generating beneficial changes in HDL-C is still controversial. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether there is a benefit of physical exercise on HDL-C levels. This is a systematic review of meta-analyses in articles indexed to PubMed/MEDLINE, SciELO and LILACS. We used the terms Lipoproteins, Cholesterol, HDL, Exercise and Resistance Training. Inclusion criteria: Meta-analyses published until January 22, 2015, with exercise as an intervention and with HDL-C endpoint. Exclusion criteria: No citation of confounding effects, assessment of HDL-C as a secondary endpoint, or dietary intervention. Regarding the aerobic training results, we evaluated eight studies. Four were significant for increased HDL-C. Of these the shortest duration in weeks was 21.8±19.5 and the highest was 35.3±31.8; the lowest frequency was 3.5±1.0 and the highest 4.0±1.1; the lowest intensity/%VO2max was 64.8% and the highest 69.2±10.1. Four studies were not significant, being the shortest duration in weeks: 10.7±3.2 and the highest 23.19±17.7; the lowest frequency was 3.7±0.8 and the highest was 4.75±2.5; the lowest intensity/%VO2maxwas 64.2±9.4 and the highest 74.7 ± 11.8. Resistance training: None of the three studies was significant. Combined training: A single study showed an increase in HDL-C levels (mean difference [95% CI]: 0.08 [95% CI, 0.05 -0.12 mmol/L]).We concluded that it is not possible to state that aerobic training, resisted or combined, provides significant increases in HDL-C levels, which limits its prescription as an efficient therapy for HDL-C increase.

Method: 13 women were involved (20 to 40 years) in two types of stimuli: strength, composed by back squat, dead lift and bent-over row (three sets of 10 repetitions) and aerobic in rowing ergometer (two sets of 10 min at 85% heart rate reserve - 5 min recovery). The efforts were performed in two orders: strength + aerobic or aerobic + strength, with 10 min intervals in between. Rating of perceived exertion, heart rate, blood lactate threshold and power were measured. Results: For rating of perceived exertion and heart rate no differences were pointed between trainings orders. No differences were found between workouts for power output in strength exercises. The power output analysis in aerobic stimulus showed differences between workouts (F (1.12) = 4.1; p = 0.03) and between sets (F (1.12) = 4.1; p = 0.03), with significant interactions (F (1.12) = 2.81; p = 0.04), post-hoc analysis identified lower power output in aerobic stimulus when performed after strength stimulus. Differences were found between moments and groups in blood lactate concentration, with higher value in strength stimulus when compared to aerobic (6.19 ± 0.1 mmol/l versus 4.34 ± 0.2 mmol/l, respectively). Conclusions: The concurrent training with rowing ergometer affected performance in aerobic effort when it was performed after strength stimulus. For strength training, it seems to have no differences in the execution order. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=152388935&site=ehost-live"

This study focused on evaluating the effects of a concurrent training program on functional autonomy of postmenopausal elderly. 51 elderly were selected residents in the city of Muriaé (MG), volunteers, divided into two groups, a concurrent training group (CTG=25), with a mean age of 69.44±6.82years and a control group (CG=26) with mean age of 68.30±6.34 years. The biophysical parameters were estimated using the body mass, height and body mass index. The assessment of function0061l autonomy was made by the test battery of the Latin American Development Group for Maturity (LADGM), composed of: walk 10m (W10m), rising from a sitting position (RSP), rising from a recumbent position ventral (RRPV), rising from a chair and walk around the house (RCWH) and the test of wear and take a T-shirt (WTT). After the intervention, the CTG offered very little value in W10m and RRPV tests; regular in RCWH testing, WTT and index LADGM and good in RSP test. The results showed that the CTG in the post-test showed better results in all the variables of the functional autonomy, except in the test RRPV (p=0.057) compared to the CG (p <0.0125). In intragroup evaluation in CTG, we found statistically significant differences in the functional autonomy tests W10m (p=0.007), RSP (p=0.000) and index LADGM (p=0.007). This research confirms that regular physical activity is essential for the restoration and control of the functional autonomy of the elderly population.

The training method was composed by a aerobic program (Fitrobic), a program located (Fitloc) and flexibility (Fitflex). The methodology was based on the distribution of the loads of physical training, proportional to the day of flight of the aeronauts. Descriptive and inference statistics were used. The results showed significant alterations in the aeronauts' physical conditioning, demonstrating high adhesion degree and the functionality of the method. In conclusion, regular practice of AEROFIT was recommended, as a form to improve physical conditioning and, the degree of tolerance to fatigue.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-960111&site=ehost-live"

One group of rats (n=5), the combined resistance-aerobic group (RA) were submitted to exercise and a sedentary control group (C) (n=5) was included. Rats were trained to climb a 1.1 m vertical (80° incline) ladder with weights tied to their tails, which were progressively augmented. After each resistance training session, the animals were trained to run 1 hour/day on the treadmill. Exercise training was performed 5 times weekly for 8 weeks. After the sacrifice, the myocardium was perfused with glutaralde hyde and the LV was isolated and weighed. Themid-zone of the LV free wall was incised transversely obtaining a ring with a thickness of 0.5 cm, which was included in Epon resin yielding blocks for performing histological sections transversely to the long axis of the cavity with 0.5 μm thick that were stained with to luidine blue and used to measure the diameter of the cavity and the thickness of the wall. The results showed that the values of the LV weight was 10.5% larger in the RA group (P< 0.05), compared with the C group, the LV wall thickness was 8% larger in the RA group (P<0.05), than in C group and the LV internal diameter was 4.5% larger in RA group (P <0.05), than in C group. Conclusion: The resistance-aerobic training used in this study induced the development of a specific type of hypertrophy of the LV wall, which combines the effects of aerobic training and resistance training. The resistance-aerobic training increases the ventricular cavity while increasing wall thickness.

Both strength training and an aerobic endurance program are important to avoid functional decline associated with age. Objective: To evaluate the effects of a combined training program of strength and endurance on handgrip strength, muscle mass, endurance and aerobic power of elderly women. Methods: Thirty-five women (65.7±6.68 years) were divided into three groups: combined training (CT, n=15), strength training (ST, n=10) and aerobic training (AT, n=10). Each group trained twice a week during eight weeks, and the CT group had strength and aerobic training once a week. We used the ANOVA statistical test and the Student’s t test, with p≤0.05. Results: It was possible to observe significant improvements (p≤0.05) for VO2max values when determining the anaerobic threshold and increase grip strength in all groups studied, as well as the muscle mass of the vastus lateralis (p≤0.05). Conclusion: The results suggest that a combined training program is as much effective to cause increases of muscle mass, strength, and aerobic endurance in elderly women as aerobic endurance or strength training performed twice a week, arranged separately.

Objective: To analyze the effects of physical training on vascular endothelial function in patients who underwent CABG surgery alone in the last phase of rehabilitation after six months of cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP). Methods: Patients who underwent CABG surgery in a maximum period of one year after surgery were included in the study. The CRP was carried out during six consecutive months, with three sessions per week. All patients underwent biochemical blood tests, muscle strength testing of one repetition maximum (1-RM test) for upper and lower limbs, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and evaluation of endothelial function through the flow-mediated vasodilation technique. Results: Eleven patients started CRP, but only nine patients completed it. The mean age was 66 years old (50 to 82 years old), males being predominant (55.6%). There were significant changes in biochemical laboratory tests: increase on total cholesterol (Baseline: 162 ± 31mg/dL vs. 195 ± 39mg/dL; P=0.012), and decrease on glycated hemoglobin (Baseline: 6.74 ± 1.64% vs. 6.26 ± 1.62%; P=0.028). Muscle strength was significantly increased in upper and lower limbs (P=0.030, and P=0.038, respectively) and in 6MWT we observed a significant increase of 20% in distance traveled (P=0.020) after six consecutive months of training. There was also a flow-mediated vasodilation improvement (6.35 ± 3.92% vs. 9.90 ± 4.19%; P=0.026).

Sixty male volleyball players (circa peak-height-velocity [PHV]: -1 to +1 year from PHV) were assigned to a combined training group (CTG) (n = 20), a plyometric training group (PTG) (n = 20), or a control group (n = 20). The experimental groups (CTG and PTG) participated in training twice weekly for 16 weeks. Thigh muscle volume, body fat, flexibility, sprint, jump height, and medicine ball throw were measured before and after the intervention and after the period of detraining. Respectively, the CTG and PTG showed increases in thigh muscle volume (effect size: 0.71 and 0.42) and decreases in body fat (-0.42 and -0.34), as well as improvements in 5-m sprint (-0.69 and -0.46), 10-m sprint (-0.31 and -0.3), lower-body muscle power (0.44 and 0.36), and upper-body muscle power (1.32 and 0.7). After the detraining period, all groups maintained previously attained muscle power (6.79-9.87%; p < 0.001). In conclusion, combined strength and plyometric training provided better improvements than plyometric training only. The combination of strength and plyometric training is a time-effective training modality that confers improvements in physical performance measures, muscle size, and body fat. A temporary period of detraining may not undermine performance gains in pubertal volleyball players.

The intervention consisted of performing the Super-circuit, in which Nautilus-type machines are interspersed with bicycle ergometers, three times a week. Additionally, subjects were asked to jump rope for a total of one hour/week. Subjects were volunteers who were also participating in a randomized study examining the relationship between exercise and bone health. Baseline and post-test included resting metabolic rate (RMR), maximum aerobic capacity (max VO2), body composition performed on a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry machine, and an estimate of one-repetition maximum lifts on the Super-circuit machines. A one-way ANOVA demonstrated that the RMR of the exercisers expressed relative to body weight and adjusted for FFM were significantly higher than the control group at baseline (p is 0.03 and p is 0.002, respectively). At post-test, no significant differences were found for RMR between groups by ANCOVA analysis with baseline RMR as the covariate. However, a paired t-test showed significant decreases occurred within the exercise group for absolute and adjusted RMR, and RMR relative to bodyweight (p (less than) 0.002), while no significant change occurred within the control group. Overall strength increased 17(percent) in the exercise group (p is 0.02), although compliance with the exercise protocol averaged only 1.7 x/wk for the Super-circuit and 33.8 min/wk of jumping rope. A repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a time by group interaction for FFM (p is 0.0005). A paired t-test showed that the exercise group increased FFM 3.6(percent) (p is 0.0001), while the control group did not change. Max VO2 and percent body fat remained unchanged following the exercise protocol. The 13.8(percent) decrease in absolute RMR within the exercise group in this study is similar to the results of an aerobic intervention by Poehlman et. al (1986), in which an 8(percent) decrease in absolute RMR was observed. However, others have reported either no change or an increase in RMR following an exercise intervention. Thus, further research is necessary to continue to address the relationship between exercise and RMR.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH367498&site=ehost-live"

Every protocol presented a decrease in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) 1 minute after finishing the training session, however, only the protocol with the intensity of 50% 1RM and 80-90% WHR presented a significant hypotensive effect (p ≤ 0.05). None of the protocols presented a significant decrease in the diastolic blood pressure. We concluded that the hypotensive effect in the SBP can be observed when the CT is performed at the intensity of 50% of 1RM and of 80-90% of the WHR.

Incorporating both aerobic and resistance training via the FBES improves multiple aspects of fitness but not balance. These results are similar to those from larger, more expensive hydraulic exercise machines. This study supports the efficacy of the FBES for older adults and implementation is feasible in multiple settings as it is relatively inexpensive and requires little space.

Sixteen canoeists participated, divided into 3 groups: 5 in experimental group 1 (EG1), 5 in experimental group 2 (EG2), and 6 in a control group. The EG1 underwent a supervised program consisted by simple static stretching, dynamic static stretching, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), whereas the EG2 performed a program without PNF and no supervision. Two measurements were performed to analyze the effect on the knee joint range of motion (ROM) and trunk flexion; neuromuscular and contractile properties in biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles; and maximum power and average speed in lower limbs. A mixed-design factorial analysis of variance (p ≤ 0.05) was performed and the effect size was calculated. The results show significant improvements (p ≤ 0.05) in both legs for knee joint ROM and trunk flexion in EG1 (8.9 and 25.5%; 5.7 and 20.9% in the right and left leg, respectively) and EG2 (6.7 and 22%; 3.9 and 24.4%), only EG1 improved muscular stiffness in BF (27.4% left leg) and ST (20.5 and 24.3%), and lateral symmetry in BF (49%) without decreasing average speed in lower limbs. All improvements have a large effect size. In conclusion, it is suggested that a supervised hamstring flexibility program performed concurrently during a canoeist competition season can produce an increase in the knee joint ROM and trunk flexion, without negative repercussions in contractile and neuromuscular capacities, maximum power, and average velocity in lower limbs.

Reduced aerobic capacity, lower muscle strength and altered motor control have been suggested as contributing factors for musculoskeletal injuries in dancers. This randomized controlled trial examined whether an intervention program improves aerobic capacity and explosive strength and reduces musculoskeletal injuries in dancers. Forty-four dancers were randomly allocated to a 4-month conditioning (i.e. endurance, strength and motor control training) or health promotion program (educational sessions). Outcome assessment was conducted by blinded assessors. When accounting for differences at baseline, no significant differences were observed between the groups following the intervention, except for the subscale “Pain” of the Short Form 36 Questionnaire ( p = 0.03). Injury incidence rate and the proportion of injured dancers were identical in both groups, but dancers following the conditioning program had significant less low back injuries ( p = 0.02). Supplementing regular dance training with a 4-month conditioning program does not lead to a significant increase in aerobic capacity or explosive strength in pre-professional dancers compared to a health promotion program without conditioning training, but leads to less reported pain. Further research should explore how additional training may be organized, taking into account the demanding dance schedule of pre-professional dancers. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01440153. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=99636401&site=ehost-live"

Design: A randomized two-group parallel controlled trial. Setting: A senior resident's hostel in Switzerland. Participants: Thirty-two individuals randomized to either strength or strength and functional exercise groups. Interventions: Both groups received machine-driven strength training for 45 min, twice weekly, for 12 weeks. The strength and functional exercises group received an additional 30 min of functional exercise training, once weekly. Main outcome measures: Tinetti test, balance tests and a physical performance test. Assessments were performed before and after the intervention. Results: Improvements for the balance test depended on the type of training (significant interaction effects [ F(1,20) = 6.7; P= 0.018]). This test improved from 11.3±11.7 to 17±11.2 (P=0.009) in the combined training group ( n=12) and remained from 7.39/9.5 to 6.99/9.2 unchanged (P=0.821) in the strength training group ( n=13). A significant difference between groups following training was observed (P=0.031). The Tinetti balance score and the chair stand test of the physical performance assessment improved from 14.3±1.9 to 15.3±1.1 (P=0.026) and 1.8±1.2 to 2.8±1.1 ( P=0.012) respectively in the combined training group only. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that twice-weekly lower extremity strength training of 12 weeks' duration in hostel-dwelling elderly people only improves task-specific balance performance and lower extremity physical function when additional functional exercises are added.

The purpose of this article was to compare the effects of aerobic exercise alone and resistance training alone as well as the combination of aerobic plus resistance training on glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk factors, and body composition in patients with T2DM. Eighty T2DM participants (37 men, 43 women), aged 33-69 years, were randomly divided in equal numbers (n=20) into one of four groups (aerobic, resistance, combined training, and control). Exercise training was performed three times per week for 52 weeks. After one year, 60 subjects (15 subjects in each group) were entered into the statistical analysis. Seventeen parameters were evaluated. Mean HbA1c showed statistically significant reductions in the three training groups. All subjects of training groups experienced improvement in postprandial glucose, blood pressure, VO2max, and muscular percentage. Furthermore, the reduced concentration of plasma triglycerides was significant in both aerobic exercise and combined training groups. Also, a significant reduction was observed in body fat percentage in resistance and combined groups. Combination of two forms of exercise training led to an additional improvement in some of the parameters such as A1c and triglycerides compared with aerobic alone or resistance training alone. In general, the reported results in previous studies were not obtained for whole lipid profile and BMI. Both aerobic and resistance training are effective interventions for the management of T2DM complications, but combined training is associated with greater positive changes.

Methods: Training sessions were carried out three times weekly. Each session consisted of three main parts: EMS of the knee extensor muscles (48 contractions), EMS of the plantar flexor muscles (30 contractions), and 50 plyometric jumps. Subjects were tested before (week 0), during (week 2), and after the training program (week 4), as well as once more after 2 wk of normal volleyball training (week 6). Different vertical jumps were carried out, as well as maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensor and plantar flexor muscles. Results: At week 2, MVC significantly increased (+20 % knee extensors, +13 % plantar flexors) as compared to baseline (P &lt; 0.05). After the 4-wk training program, different vertical jumps considered were also significantly higher compared to pretraining (P &lt; 0.001), and relative gains were comprised between 8-10 % (spike-counter movement jump) and 21 % (squat jump). The significant increases in maximal strength and explosive strength produced by the present training program were subsequently maintained after an additional 2 wk of volleyball training. Conclusion: EMS combined with plyometric training has proven useful for the improvement of vertical jump ability in volleyball players. This combined training modality produced rapid increases (approximately 2 wk) of the knee extensors and plantar flexors maximal strength. These adaptations were then followed by an improvement in general and specific jumping ability, likely to affect performance on the court. In conclusion, when EMS resistance training is proposed for vertical jump development, specific work out (e.g., plyometric) must complement EMS sessions to obtain beneficial effects.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-858241&site=ehost-live"

The present study investigates the effect of low-intensity RT before and after high-intensity RT on arterial stiffuess. Methods: Thirty young healthy subjects (aged 19.2 ± 0.6 y, mean +/- SD) were randomly assigned to a group that performed low-intensity RT before high-intensity RT (BLRT, n=IO), a group that performed low-intensity RT after high-intensity RT (ALRT, n=lO) and a sedentary control group (CON, n=lO). The BLRT and ALRT groups performed RT at: 80% and 50% of one repetition maximum twice each week for 1 0 wk. Arterial stiffuess was measured using carotid-femoral (cf) and femoral-ankle (fa) pulse wave velocity (PWV). Results: Both cfPWV and faPWV after combined training in the ALRT group did not change from before training. In contrast. c:IPWV after combined training in the BLRT group increased from before training (P <0.05). faPWV after combined training in the BLRT group did not change from before training. These values did not change in the CON group. Conclusion: These results suggest that although arterial stiffuess is increased by low-intensity RT before high-intensity RT, performing low-intensity RT thereafter can prevent the increasing of arterial stiffuess.

The combination of interval training and resistance training has showed interesting results in chronic heart failure patients, corroborating the benefits of physiological adaptations of both protocols. To evaluate the effect of the combination of interval training and resistance training program when compared to interval training alone and/or without intervention group on cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with chronic heart failure. We search MEDLINE via PubMed, ScienceDirect, Sportdiscus, BIREME and Scielo, from their inception to December 2018. Were included both randomized and non-randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of combined training, interval training alone and/or WI group on VO 2peak (expressed in ml/kg/min), in people with chronic heart failure patients. The meta-analysis was conducted via Review Manager v 5.3 software, using random effect model. Ten articles were selected (nine randomized controlled trial), involving 401 participants. Six studies compared combined training with interval training and six studies compared combined training with the without intervention group. Eighty percent of the trials presented moderate risk of bias and twenty percent low risk of bias. Data showed significant difference and major increase in VO 2peak in favor to combined training group compared to interval training group (SMD = 0.25; CI = 0.04–0.46) and without intervention group (SMD = 0.46; CI = 0.29–0.64), respectively. The combination of interval training and resistance training showed more effective in increasing cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with heart failure than interval training alone and non-exercise therapy. However, further studies should be conducted to increase the understanding of this combined training method.

From this perspective, there is the possibility of combining both aerobic and resistance training in a single exercise session with the purpose of increasing training volume and optimiz- ing physiological adaptations, while preserving positive affective responses. Until now, no study has assessed ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and sensations of pleasure/displeasure (SPD) during a combined training session in obese women. The present study aimed to: (1) assess RPE and SPD during a combined training session in obese women; and (2) compare RPE and SPD responses during different resistance training exercises. Twelve sedentary obese women (age: 39.2 ±11.1 years; height: 160.4 ± 5.9 cm; body mass: 87.4 ± 5.8 kg; BMI: 33.6 ±1.2 kg.m-2 ) performed a combined aerobic and resistance training session. RPE and SPD were recorded during the session. Data were analyzed with One-way repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni's post hoc tests. The results revealed that, despite the increase in exercise volume, RPE responses were low and affective responses were positive. There were no significant differences in RPE and SPD values among resistance exercises. Combined aerobic and resistance training can be prescribed during the initial phase of a training program because it produces low perceived exertion and positive affective responses.

Outcome variables assessed included aerobic capacity, yo-yo intermittent recovery test 2 (YYIRT2), 30-meter sprint, agility and explosive power. Both the RST and COM training groups significantly improved distance ran on the YYIRT2 and the maximum velocity on the VO2 max test compared to CON after six weeks of training (p<0.01). Only the RST group improved VO2 max compared to CON (p<0.05). No other significant between-group differences were found. Conditioning coaches of sub-elite football players have the opportunity to use either RST or COM training during the preparation of their players in the pre-season but RST provides an additional benefit of improved VO2 max and which has also been shown to correlate with physical performance in elite football matches.

Forty-eight physical education students (ages, 21.4 +/- 1.3 years) were assigned to 1 of 5 groups: no training controls (C, n = 9), endurance training (E, n = 10), circuit training (S, n = 9), endurance before circuit training in the same session, (E+S, n = 10), and circuit before endurance training in the same session (S+E, n = 10). Subjects performed 2 sessions per week for 12 weeks. Resistance-type circuit training targeted strength endurance (weeks 1-6) and explosive strength and power (weeks 7-12). Endurance training sessions included 5 repetitions run at the velocity associated with Vo2max (Vo2max) for a duration equal to 50% of the time to exhaustion at Vo2max; recovery was for an equal period at 60% Vo2max. Maximal strength in the half squat, strength endurance in the 1-leg half squat and hip extension, and explosive strength and power in a 5-jump test and countermovement jump were measured pre- and post-testing. No significant differences were shown following training between the S+E and E+S groups for all exercise tests. However, both S+E and E+S groups improved less than the S group in 1 repetition maximum (p < 0.01), right and left 1-leg half squat (p < 0.02), 5-jump test (p < 0.01), peak jumping force (p < 0.05), peak jumping power (p < 0.02), and peak jumping height (p < 0.05). The intrasession sequence did not influence the adaptive response of muscular strength and explosive strength and power. Circuit training alone induced strength and power improvements that were significantly greater than when resistance and endurance training were combined, irrespective of the intrasession sequencing.

However, it has been found that learners do not engage in vigorous activity during PE classes and spend the majority of class time standing while roll is taken or awaiting their turn to play. This study determined the effect of a 12-week concurrent physical education and obesity-prevention training programme (CON) on the anthropometry and cardiorespiratory measures in children already at the upper limit (50th centile) of a healthy body mass index (BMI). Anthropometric measures included body mass, stature, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage while maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) was measured using the one-mile walk test. CON performed a 10-minute warm-up, followed by 40 minutes of strength and endurance training using dumbbells, medicine balls and gym ball exercises, free hand exercises using callisthenic exercises and agility and flexibility exercises using ladder and gym ball exercises and concluded each session with 10 minutes of stretching. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to determine the differences in anthropometric and cardiorespiratory variables over time between groups. A separate ANOVA with repeated measures for each group was used to determine differences over time in each group. One-way ANOVA was performed to determine the significance of differences between groups. When significance was revealed, a post-hoc test (Tukey HSD) was used to determine the differences between specific means. In the CON, there were no significant (p ≤ 0.01) differences in body mass, body fat percentage and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). However, a deleterious, significant increase was found in BMI at post-test when compared to pre-test (p = 0.001). In the PEG, there was no significant difference in body fat percentage (p = 0.108) and VO2max (p = 0.103), and the PEG too demonstrated significant increase in BMI (p = 0.008) and body mass (p = 0.002) from pre- to post-test. These findings indicate that a 12-week callisthenic programme in addition to physical education classes was not more effective than physical education classes alone. As such, more comprehensive programmes that include other treatments such as nutritional and/or behavioural modifications may be needed to curb childhood overweight and obesity.

Thirty moderately trained distance runners were randomly assigned to 10‐week CSE training (n = 15; 33.1 ± 7.5 years) or a control group (n = 15; 34.2 ± 8.2 years). Participants ran ≥30 km per week and had no experience with strength training. The primary outcome measure was 2‐km run time. Secondary outcome measures included lower limb sagittal plane biomechanics and muscle activity during running (3.89 m s−1 and maximal sprinting); maximal aerobic capacity (V̇O2max); running economy; and body composition. CSE training improved 2‐km run time (mean difference (MD): −11.3 s [95% CI −3.7, −19.0]; p = 0.006) and time to exhaustion during the V̇O2max running test (MD 59.1 s [95% CI 8.58, 109.62]; p = 0.024). The CSE training group also reduced total body fat (MD: −1.05 kg [95% CI −0.21, −1.88]; p = 0.016) while total body mass and lean body mass were unchanged. Hip joint angular velocity during the early swing phase of running at 3.89 m s−1 was the only biomechanical or muscle activity variable that significantly changed following CSE training. CSE training is beneficial for running performance, but changes in running biomechanics and muscle activity may not be contributing factors to the performance improvement. Future research should consider other possible mechanisms and the effect of CSE training on biomechanics and muscle activity during prolonged running under fatigued conditions.

Methods: Fourteen young men were randomly assigned to 2 groups: one group performed ET the same day immediately after RT (SD: n=7) and the other group the day after RT (DA: n=7). Both groups performed high-intensity preacher curls [75% of one repetition maximum (1-RM); 3-5 sets of 12 reps] followed by low-intensity exercise (cycling ergometer) [40% of VO2max] 2 times per week for a total training period of 8 weeks. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) of the biceps brachii, 1-RM strength, and maximal oxygen uptake ( V 0 2max) were evaluated. Results and Discussion: The increase in CSA of the biceps brachii in DA (12.1% ± 4 .9, p<0.05) was greater than in SD (5.0%±2.7, p<0.05). Both groups showed increases in 1-RM strength (SD: 24.3% =±11.1 and DA: 19.8% ± 16.8, p<0.05). No changes in V 0 2max could be observed in both groups. These results suggest that muscular hypertrophy and strength gains are greater if endurance training is performed the day after RT compared to immediately after RT. Further, not only high-intensity but also low-intensity endurance training seems to be sufficient to affect RT induced muscle and strength gains.

Methods. This was a controlled pilot study, with 31 women (age 30 to 59) under breast cancer treatment, 14 women were allocated to a training group (TG) who underwent CT more static stretching, concomitant to hospital treatment and 17 women for the control group (CG) who only underwent hospital treatment. The CT more static stretching was performed in 12 weeks with 5 sessions per week, three sessions (aerobic+resistance) and two sessions (stretching exercises) on alternate days. The flexibility of the shoulder was measured by means of the 360º Sanny pendulum goniometer and the flexibility of the lower limbs was assessed through the sit-and-reach test. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA Test and Bonferroni Post-hoc using SPSS 21 software, with α of 5%. Results. The TG presented increased flexibility in the horizontal abduction of the right shoulder (p=0.001) and in the lower limbs (p<0.001), but the CG showed a reduction in the horizontal abduction of the right shoulder (p=0.003). The effect size for horizontal abduction of the right shoulder was medium (p=0.508) and for the lower limbs was large (p=0.839). Conclusion. CT more static stretching may be a therapeutic intervention to increase flexibility of upper and lower limbs in women with breast cancer.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a high-intensity interval training and resistance training (HIIT + RT) program on body composition and intestinal microbiota composition in overweight or obese postmenopausal women. Methods : Participants (n = 17) were randomized in two groups: HIIT + RT group (3x per week, 12 wk) and control group without any training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to measure whole-body and abdominal/visceral FM and fat-free mass. Intestinal microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing at baseline and at the study end, and the diet was controlled. Results : Compared with sedentary controls, physical fitness (maximal oxygen consumption, peak power output) increased, total abdominal and visceral FM decreased, and segmental muscle mass increased in the training group. Although the HIIT + RT protocol did not modify [alpha]-diversity and taxonomy, it significantly influenced microbiota composition. Moreover, various intestinal microbiota members were correlated with HIIT + RT-induced body composition changes, and baseline microbiota composition predicted the response to the HIIT + RT program. Conclusions: HIIT + RT is an effective modality to reduce abdominal/visceral FM and improve physical capacity in nondieting overweight or obese postmenopausal women. Training modified intestinal microbiota composition, and the response to training seems to depend on the initial microbiota profile. More studies are needed to determine whether microbiota composition could predict the individual training response.

Combined aerobic endurance and resistance training (three sessions/ week) was performed during supplementation.Main Measures: Aerobic power was determined during graded bicycle testing, knee extensor peak isometric and isokinetic strength, endurance and recovery were assessed by an isokinetic dynamometer, and health related quality of life was evaluated with the SF-36 and MacNew Heart Disease questionnaires. In addition, blood samples were taken after an overnight fast and 24 hour urinary collection was performed.Results: At baseline there were no significant differences between both groups. We observed main time effects for aerobic power, muscle performance, health related quality of life, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (pre vs post; P<0.05 for all). However, changes after training were similar between placebo group and creatine group (P>0.05). Further, no detrimental effect on renal or liver function was observed nor were there any reports of side effects.Conclusion: Oral creatine supplementation in combination with exercise training does not exert any additional effect on the improvement in physical performance, health related quality of life, lipid profile in patients with coronary artery disease or chronic heart failure than exercise training alone.

A 12-week randomized controlled trial was conducted using a parallel group design. Sixty-five middle-aged adults (40–65 years old) were randomly assigned to: (a) no exercise (control group), (b) concurrent training based on international physical activity recommendations (PAR group), (c) high-intensity interval training (HIIT group), and (d) HIIT together with whole-body electromyostimulation (HIIT + EMS group). Plasma levels of oxylipins, eCBs, and eCBs-like molecules were determined in plasma samples before and after the intervention using targeted lipidomics. Body composition was assessed through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and dietary intake through a food frequency questionnaire and three nonconsecutive 24-hr recalls. The physical activity recommendations, HIIT, and HIIT-EMS groups showed decreased plasma levels of omega-6 and omega-3-derived oxylipins, and eCBs and eCBs-like molecules after 12 weeks (all Δ ≤ −0.12; all p <.05). Importantly, after Bonferroni post hoc corrections, the differences in plasma levels of omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins were not statistically significant compared with the control group (all p >.05). However, after post hoc corrections, plasma levels of anandamide and oleoylethanolamide were increased in the physical activity recommendations group compared with the control group (anandamide: Δ = 0.05 vs. −0.09; oleoylethanolamide: Δ = −0.12 vs. 0.013, all p ≤.049). In conclusion, this study reports that a 12-week exercise training intervention, independent of the modality applied, does not modify fasting plasma levels of omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins, eCBs, and eCBs-like molecules in middle-aged sedentary adults.

Sprint training methods were classified as specific (resisted and assisted sprinting, and nonassisted sprinting), non-specific (strength, power and plyometric training) or a combination of both methods. Thirty-six studies comparing highly trained and recreational participants were included in this review. Highly trained participants (n = 499) had to compete at international level, or in first, second or third division national teams in their sport. The remaining participants were characterized as recreational (n = 945). The effects of these methods on the sprint times of recreational and highly-trained athletes were quantified via percent changes (%change), effect statistics (ES) and training efficacy (TE), the averaged change in sprint time per session. Specific sprint training methods were found the most beneficial (%change = -2.12 ± 2.50; ES = -0.90 ± 1.40) and efficient (%change/session = -0.15 ± 0.19; ES/session = -0.05 ± 0.07) training method in decreasing sprint times of recreational athletes. The highly-trained athletes responded to specific or combined training methods the best, depending on the metric used for comparisons e.g. %change vs ES. It would seem that highly-trained athletes can handle higher training loads and would benefit from greater training variety.

Twenty recreationally active students were assigned into one of 3 groups: combined training (Com), horizontal training (H), and control (C) group. Com group performed uphill and downhill training on a sloping surface with an angle of 4°, whereas H group trained on a horizontal surface, 3 days a week for 8 weeks. Speed maintenance and deceleration phases were divided into distances with 10-m intervals, and running time (t), running velocity (RV), step frequency (SF), and step length (SL) were measured at preexercise, and postexercise period. After 8 weeks of training program, t was shortened by 3.97% in Com group, and 2.37% in H group. Running velocity also increased for totally 100 m of running distance by 4.13 and 2.35% in Com, and H groups, respectively. At the speed maintenance phase, although t and maximal RV (RVmax) found to be statistically unaltered during overall phase, t was found to be decreased, and RVmax was preceded by 10 m in distance in both training groups. Step length was increased at 60-70 m, and SF was decreased at 70-80 m in H group. Step length was increased with concomitant decrease in SF at 80--90 m in Com group. Both training groups maintained the RVmax with a great percentage at the speed maintenance phase. In conclusion, although both training methods resulted in an increase in running time and RV, Com training method was more prominently effective method in improving RV, and this improvement was originated from the positive changes in SL during the speed maintaining phase.

Exercise at self-selected intensity is a feasible strategy to avoid dropouts of training routines. We aimed to assess the effects of different training programs at self-selected intensity on body composition, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), feelings of pleasure and displeasure (FPD) and fitness outcomes (maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and maximum dynamic strength (1RM)) in obese women. Forty obese women (n = 40; Body Mass Index: 33.2 ± 1.1 kg.m-2) were randomly allocated to combined training (CT = 10), aerobic training (AT = 10), resistance training (RT = 10) and control group (CG = 10). The frequency that CT, AT and RT performed the training sessions was 3 times per week during 8 weeks. Body composition (DXA), VO2max and 1RM were assessed at baseline and after intervention. All participants were on a restricted dietary intake aiming to ingest 2.650 kcal per day. Post hoc comparisons revealed that CT promotes a larger decrease in body fat percentage (p = 0.001), body fat mass (p = 0.004) than other groups. CT and AT elicited higher VO2max increases (p = 0.014) than RT and CG, and 1RM values were higher in CT and RT (p = 0.001) than AT and CG at post-intervention. All training groups presented low RPE and high FPD over the training sessions, but only the CT was effective to reduce body fat percentage and body fat mass in obese women. In addition, CT was effective to increase simultaneously maximum oxygen uptake and maximum dynamic strength in obese women.

Some certain well-established training protocols exist for developing physical and physiological demands of a track cyclist. But still there is controversy on the effectiveness of combined training protocols. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of 4-week concurrent eccentric cycling and plyometric training on cycling performance of male cyclists at the pre-competitive phase. Material and methods. A paired study design was applied to 15 young (15.04 ± 1.01 yrs) Indian male track cyclists to assess the effects of proposed concurrent training protocol on body composition and various physical fitness parameters. Results. Hydration status [TBW (~1%) and ICW (~1%)], glycogen content (~3%), muscular strength (~6-11%), trunk flexibility (~5%), anaerobic power output (~9%), endurance capacity (~5%), acceleration (~7%), leg explosive strength (~7%) and agility (~2%) were found to be improved significantly after the 4-week concurrent training protocol. Conclusions. The concurrent intervening physical training protocol was intended to increase muscular hypertrophy, peripheral factor gradient, glycolytic and oxidative enzyme capacity with proper neuromuscular coordination which may ultimately help the cyclists to pedal at a faster rate with higher muscular power output even for longer time.

This study evaluated whether endurance training (ET), strength training (ST), or their combination (EST) alters these metabolic and morphometric aberrations as a mechanism for functional improvement. Five groups were evaluated: 1) controls; 2) MHD/no training; 3) MHD/ET; 4) MHD/ST; and 5) MHD/EST. Training duration was 21.5 ± 0.7 wk. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained after HD at baseline and at study end. Muscle fibers were classified immunohistochemically, and fiber CSAs were computed. Individual fiber SDH activity was determined by a microdensitometric assay. Capillaries were identified using antibodies against endothelial cells. Type I and IIA fiber CSAs decreased significantly (10%) with EST. In the ET group, SDH activity increased 16.3% in type IIA and 19.6% in type IIX fibers. Capillary density increased significantly by 28% in the EST group and 14.3% with ET. The number of capillaries surrounding individual fiber type increased significantly in EST and ET groups. Capillary-to-fiber ratio increased significantly by 11 and 9.6% in EST and ET groups, respectively. We conclude that increments in capillarity and possibly SDH activity in part underlie improvements in endurance of MHD patients posttraining. We speculate that improved specific force and/or neural adaptations to exercise underlie improvements in limb muscle strength of MHD patients.

Over the last decade, physical exercise has been increasingly incorporated as a complementary intervention in the strategies against cancer helping to mitigate the adverse effects of chemotherapies. PURPOSE: This study investigated the effect of an exercise training program on physical performance and QoL in breast cancer (BCa) patients during their chemotherapy. METHODS: Seven female BCa patients under chemotherapy (age: 40.14±4.67 yrs, height: 1.64±0.04 m, mass: 68.24±12.70 kg, BMI: 25.28±4.95 kg/m²) participated in an individualized, supervised exercise program containing both aerobic and resistance training, 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The ""Rockport 1 mile walk test"", ""Sit to Stand (60 sec)"", ""Sit Ups (60 sec)"" and ""handgrip"" tests were used to evaluate patients' aerobic capacity and muscular strength every 4 weeks, while QoL was self-estimated using the EORTC-QLQ30 questionnaire. RESULTS: After the completion of the 12-week exercise program, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was increased significantly by 18±19% (p<0.05), as well as the handgrip strength of the arm on the mastectomy side by 22±19% (p<0.05) and the Sit-Ups performance by 67±45% (p<0.001). No significant improvements were observed in the handgrip strength of the arm on the non-operated side (13±12%; p>0.05) and in the ""Sit to stand"" test (26±38%; p>0.05). A high variability was observed in the improvements of functional ability (by 8±18%, 18±20% and 20±19%; p>0.05) and QoL (by 2±26%, 15±20% and 8±25%; p>0.05), and in the reduction of fatigue (by 12±24%, 14±67% and 28±95%; p>0.05) at the 4th, 8th and 12th week of the exercise intervention program, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a 12-week exercise training improved aerobic capacity and muscular strength of BCa patients undergoing chemotherapy, while less distinct improvements were revealed in the functional ability, fatigue and QoL of these patients. These findings suggest that the adverse effects of chemotherapy can be reduced by exercise training and BCa patients should be engaged in appropriately designed, individualized exercise programs.

Methods: A total of 89 healthy sedentary adults (53% women; 53.5 ± 4.9 years old) were enrolled in the FIT-AGEING study. The participants were randomized to (1) a control group (no exercise), (2) physical activity recommendation from the World Health Organization (PAR group), (3) high-intensity interval training (HIIT group), and (4) HIIT adding whole-body electromyostimulation training (HIIT + EMS). 1,25(OH)2D plasma levels were measured using a DiaSorin Liaison immunochemiluminometric analyzer. Results: Compared with the control group, 1,25(OH)2D increased in PAR (Δ = 10.99 ± 3.44 pg/mL; P = 0.01), HIIT (Δ = 11.63 ± 3.51 pg/mL; P = 0.009), and HIIT + EMS groups (Δ = 14.01 ± 3.59 pg/mL; P = 0.001) without statistical differences between them (all P s > 0.1). Conclusion: In summary, the results show that a 12-week exercise intervention produced an increment of 1,25(OH)2D independently of age, sex, and exercise modality in healthy sedentary adults. Clinical Relevance: The implementation of physical exercise could be considered a strategy not only aiming to reverse the seasonal decrease of 1,25(OH)2D in winter explained by low sunlight exposure but also for obtaining subsequent increases of this hormone even in these a priori adverse conditions.

Resistance training consisted of one set of 8-12 repetitions on ten Nautilus machines three times per week. The endurance training group progressed to training at 75-85% VO2max for 35-45 min three times per week for the last 2 months of training. No changes in body weight or estimated lean body mass occurred; however, the sum of seven skinfolds, as an index of percent body fat, decreased in both exercise groups. Upper and lower body strength increased with resistance training, while VO2max increased by 20% in the endurance training group. Blood pressure did not change with resistance training in individuals with normal or somewhat elevated blood pressures. Diastolic and mean blood pressure decreased significantly, by 5 and 4 mm Hg, with endurance training. Subjects with blood pressure greater than 140/90 reduced their systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure by 8, 9, and 8 mm Hg, respectively, with endurance exercise training. Cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance, and plasma levels of angiotensin I and II and epi- and norepinephrine did not change in any of the groups. Thus, resistance exercise training does not adversely affect, or reduce, blood pressure, while endurance exercise training produces modest reductions in blood pressure in 70-79-yr-old individuals with somewhat elevated blood pressures.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH307792&site=ehost-live"

The objective of this study was to determine whether exercise training can improve LV diastolic function in individuals with MetS. Twenty-eight individuals with MetS (9 males, aged 60 ± 5 years) underwent a 1-year combined endurance and resistance exercise training program; maximal aerobic capacity ( V̇O2max), blood pressure, blood markers, and LV diastolic function were measured at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 52 throughout the training. Pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography across the mitral valve was used to assess peak early flow velocity (E) and peak atrial flow velocity (A) to determine the E/A ratio. Individuals with MetS had a reversed E/A ratio, suggesting impaired LV relaxation, the first stage of LV diastolic dysfunction. Exercise training reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) (129 ± 14 to 120 ± 12 mm Hg; p < 0.01) and increased V̇O2max (29.2 ± 6.3 to 33.4 ± 6.5 mL·kg−1·min−1; p < 0.01) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.04 ± 0.21 to 1.12 ± 0.25 mmol·L−1; p = 0.02), but did not improve LV diastolic function. Individuals with an E/A ratio <1 at the start of training had a tendency toward an increased E/A ratio ( p = 0.12) accompanied by significant decreases in SBP and increases in V̇O2max with exercise training. Combined resistance and aerobic exercise training improved cardiometabolic health but did not improve the impaired LV diastolic function of individuals with MetS.

Seventeen well-trained Nordic Combined athletes were assigned to either usual training supplemented with heavy strength training (STR; n = 8) or to usual training without heavy strength training (CON; n = 9). The strength training performed by STR consisted of one lower-body exercise and two upper-body exercises [3-5 repetition maximum (RM) sets of 3-8 repetitions], which were performed twice a week for 12 weeks. Architectural changes in m. vastus lateralis, 1RM in squat and seated pull-down, squat jump (SJ) height, maximal oxygen consumption ( VO), work economy during submaximal treadmill skate rollerskiing, and performance in a 7.5-km rollerski time trial were measured before and after the intervention. STR increased 1RM in squat and seated pull-down, muscle thickness, and SJ performance more than CON ( p < 0.05) . There was no difference between groups in change in work economy. The two groups showed no changes in total body mass, VO, or time-trial performance.

Twenty well-trained cyclists were assigned to either usual endurance training combined with heavy strength training [E + S; n = 11 (male symbol = 11)] or to usual endurance training only [E; n = 9 (male symbol = 7, female symbol = 2)]. The strength training performed by E + S consisted of four lower body exercises [3 x 4-10 repetition maximum (RM)], which were performed twice a week for 12 weeks. Thigh muscle CSA, maximal force in isometric half squat, power output in 30 s Wingate test, maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)), power output at 2 mmol l(-1) blood lactate concentration ([la(-)]), and performance, as mean power production, in a 40-min all-out trial were measured before and after the intervention. E + S increased thigh muscle CSA, maximal isometric force, and peak power in the Wingate test more than E. Power output at 2 mmol l(-1) [la(-)] and mean power output in the 40-min all-out trial were improved in E + S (P < 0.05). For E, only performance in the 40-min all-out trial tended to improve (P = 0.057). The two groups showed similar increases in VO(2max) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, adding strength training to usual endurance training improved determinants of cycling performance as well as performance in well-trained cyclists. Of particular note is that the added strength training increased thigh muscle CSA without causing an increase in body mass.

"Effect of high intensity functional training and traditional resistance training on aerobic, anaerobic, and musculoskeletal fitness improvement.","MCWEENY, DAVID K.; BOULE, NORMAND G.; NETO, JOAO HENRIQUE FALK; KENNEDY, MICHAEL D.","Journal of Physical Education & Sport",="22478051",,="20200601","20","4","1791","12","146868595",,,"Article","FUNCTIONAL training; PHYSICAL training & conditioning; ATHLETE training; PHYSICAL fitness -- Physiological aspects; AEROBIC capacity; MUSCLE strength",,"Problem statement: High intensity functional training is a popular training modality where individuals complete as many repetitions as possible in sequence to solicit maximal fatigue in a workout. Despite the popularity of these programs it is unclear whether this approach improves fitness more than a traditional resistance training program. Purpose: Thus, we aimed to understand whether muscular, aerobic and anaerobic fitness were improved via high intensity functional training compared to traditional resistance training. Approach: Thirty healthy male and female participants (23.2±3.2 years) were randomly assigned to free exercise, high intensity functional training, or traditional; n=10.High intensity functional training and traditional workouts were supervised and training volume was similar while the free exercise group maintained normal exercise across the 6 weeks. The same test battery was performed pre-post and additional physical activity recorded for each group. Results: Significant post training group differences were: high intensity functional training lower body anaerobic power was less than free exercise and traditional type training; and upper body muscle endurance was greater in high intensity functional training compared to traditional type training. There were significant improvements in all muscle strength measures for both types of training groups and aerobic power improved in the high intensity functional training group (p<0.05).However, the free exercise group also improved in many post assessments which implies a learning effect. Further, the lack of improved anaerobic fitness in either training group indicates excessive accumulated fatigue. Conclusions: Given our results, high intensity functional training or traditional will improve muscle strength and high intensity functional training likely improves aerobic power and upper body muscle endurance more. However, both types of training are very intense and may lead to undue fatigue in recreationally active adults.

However, no intervention studies have yet proven their effectiveness. This study aimed to analyze the effect of 8 weeks of HRC in hypoxia on aerobic performance, resting energy expenditure (REE), repeat sprint ability (RSA) and hematological variables. Twenty‐eight subjects were assigned to hypoxia (FiO2 = 15%; HRChyp: n = 15; age: 24.6 ± 6.8 years; height: 177.4 ± 5.9 cm; weight: 74.9 ± 11.5 kg) and normoxia (FiO2 = 20.9%; HRCnorm: n = 13; age: 23.2 ± 5.2 years; height: 173.4 ± 6.2 cm; weight: 69.4 ± 7.4 kg) groups. Each training session consisted of two blocks of three exercises (Block 1: bench press, leg extension, front pull down; 2: deadlift, elbow flexion, ankle extension). Each exercise was performed at 6 repetitions maximum. Participants exercised twice weekly for 8 weeks and before and after the training program blood test, REE, RSA and treadmill running test were performed. Fatigue index in the RSA test was significantly decreased in the HRChyp (−0.9%; P < .01; ES = 2.75) but not in the HRCnorm. No changes were observed in REE and hematological variables. Absolute (4.5%; P = .014; ES = 0.42) and relative (5.2%; P = .008; ES = 0.43) maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), speed at VO2max (4%; P = .010; ES = 0.25) and time to exhaustion (4.1%; P = .012; ES = 0.26) were significantly increased in HRChyp but not in the HRCnorm. No significant differences between groups were found. Compared with normoxic conditions, 8 weeks of HRC training under hypoxic conditions efficiently improves aerobic performance and RSA without changes in REE and red blood O2‐carrying capacity.

Eighty-six soccer players from the same academy were categorized into 3 groups by age (under 13 years, U13, n = 30; under 15, U15, n = 28; and under 17, U17, n = 28) and then randomly assigned into 2 subgroups: a strength training group (STG) and a control group (CG). The strength training program was performed twice a week for 6 weeks and consisted of full squats (load: 45-60% 1 repetition maximum; volume: 3 set of 8-4 repetitions), jumps, and straight line sprint exercises. After training intervention, the STGs showed significant improvements in maximal strength (7.5-54.5%; p < 0.001), jump height (5.7-12.5%; p <0.01-0.001), and sprint time (-3.7 to -1.2%; p ≤0.05-0.001), whereas no significant gains were found for any variable in the CGs. Comparison between experimental groups resulted in a greater magnitude of change for U13 compared with U15 (effect sizes [ES]: 0.10-0.53) and U17 (ES: 0.14-1.41) soccer players in most variables, whereas U15 showed higher improvements in jump and strength parameters than U17 (ES: 0.25-0.90) soccer players. Thus, although our results indicates that a combined weight training and plyometrics program may be effective in eliciting gains in strength, jump, and sprint in soccer players of different ages, the training program used appears to be generally less effective as the age of the soccer players increased. Therefore, it appears that training characteristics (mainly volume, intensity, and type of exercise) should be modified in relation to maturity status and initial strength level.

The aim of this study was to assess the physical capacity of construction workers and evaluate the effect of individually tailored exercise programs on their physical fitness and muscular capacity. Method The study was a randomized controlled trial of male constructions workers allocated to either an exer-cise or control group. The intervention lasted 12 weeks, and the exercise group trained 3 x 20 minutes a week. The participants completed health checks before and after the intervention period. Data from the first health check were used to tailor the exercise in the interventions. Results At baseline, participants had maximal oxygen consumption (V02max) of 2.9 [standard deviation (SD) 0.7] 1/min and body mass index (BMI) of 28.3 (SD 4.7). Compared to representative data on employees in Denmark (N=78), this study population (N=67) had significantly lower relative aerobic capacity [difference in z-score -1.13, standard error (SE) 0.1, P<0.001] and higher BMI [difference in z-score 1.10, SE 0.2, P<0.001] at baseline. With respect to the intervention, group x time analyses showed a significant difference in estimated change in V02max of 0.4 1/min for the exercise group and 0.0 1/min for the control group (P<0.001). Body mass and other general health measures remained unchanged. Conclusion Training for 20 minutes, 3 times a week significantly increased V02max with a clinically relevant magnitude regarding risk of cardiometabolic disorders. This study demonstrates a good effectiveness for integrat-ing short exercise bouts into organizational routines among constructions workers.

Stroke can result in severe motor deficits, and many people who have survived a stroke have poor cardiovascular fitness, with potentially disabling effects on daily life. Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of intensive physical training on gait performance and cardiovascular health parameters in people with stroke in the chronic stage. Design. This was a single-group, pretest-posttest experimental study. Methods. Fourteen people with hemiparesis after cerebrovascular injury (mean age=58.4 years, mean time since injury=25 months) participated in a 12-week training intervention, 5 times per week for 1.5 hours per session. The intervention consisted of high-intensity, body-weight--supported treadmill training; progressive resistance strength training; and aerobic exercise. The main outcome measures were gait performance (Six-Minute Walk Test, 10-Meter Walk Test, and aerobic capacity) and parameters of cardiovascular health (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, and resting heart rate). Results. Significant improvements in all main outcome parameters were observed in response to the intervention. Gait speed during the Six-Minute Walk Test increased 62%, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased 10% and 11%, respectively. Weekly testing of walking speed showed that most of the increase in the walking speed occurred in the first 8 weeks of training. Correlation analyses showed that improvements were unrelated to age, chronicity, or level of functioning. Conclusions. High-intensity physical training for people with stroke in the chronic stage increased walking speed regardless of chronicity, age, or level of functioning. Further studies should investigate the intervention duration needed to reach the full potential of gait recovery.

Twenty-four healthy young adults were allocated into two different groups differing only in the exercise order to conduct an 8-week intra-session concurrent training programme consisting of three sessions of 60–90 minutes (180–270 min/week), with all-out running sprint intervals, back squat, and bench press endurance and resistance exercises (i.e., ET+RT and RT+ET). The 8-week intra-session concurrent training programme overall improved all the components of physical fitness regardless of the exercise sequence. However, ET + RT and RT + ET groups reported moderate and small improvements for squat jump (ET + RT: 3.82 cm [1.11 to 6.53 cm]; RT + ET: 0.31 cm [−1.72 to 2.33 cm]), countermovement jump (ET + RT: 3.76 cm [1.43 to 6.08 cm]; RT + ET: 2.07 cm [−0.03 to 4.17 cm]) and maximum oxygen uptake (ET + RT: 4.75 ml/kg/min [1.14 to 8.35 ml/kg/min]; RT + ET: 1.66 ml/kg/min [−0.89 to 4.21 ml/kg/min]), respectively. Therefore, greater lower-body power and cardiorespiratory fitness gains might be induced following the ET + RT sequence.

The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to analyze the effects of phototherapy and combined training on clinical, functional, and psychological outcomes and on vascular endothelial growth factor. Methods: This randomized placebo-controlled trial by stratified sample will involve 45 healthy male participants. In phase 1, the participants will undergo six weeks of combined training (sprints and squats). In phase 2, participants will be allocated through stratified randomization (based on adaptation capacity) into three groups: active phototherapy group (AG), placebo group (PG), and non-treatment control group (CG). A new six-week training program will then start and the participants will receive the recovery strategy between sprints and squats. The primary outcome will be maximal isometric contraction. The secondary outcomes include strength and power testing, maximal incremental test, squat jump, sprint test, muscle soreness, pain threshold, perceptions of exertion and recovery, psychological questionnaire, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Conclusions: This will be the first trial to include phototherapy during training. We believe that this strategy will combine the ergogenic and prophylactic effects in the same session. Furthermore, an application protocol performed after primary adaptation may reflect the real effect of the technique.

Although the combination of aerobic and resistance training leads to more significant improvements in health-related indices for T2D patients, the interference effect in concurrent training can decrease positive adaptations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the physiological adaptations in performing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance training on the same day vs. different days in T2D patients. Twenty-four non-athletic 45–65-year-old women with T2D participated in an 8-week intervention. They were randomly divided into three groups: same days (SD), different days (DD), and treatment as usual (control). SD group had resistance training followed by HIIT on Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday. In contrast, the DD group had the same volume of resistance training on Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday and HIIT on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, with Friday as a resting day. Blood samples were collected 24 h before the first and 48 h after the last session in each group to measure glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, IGF1, IL1β, CRP, lipid profile, miR-146a, and miR-29b. Three subjects dropped out during the study, and 21 participants (SD = 7, DD = 6, Control = 8) completed the 8-week intervention. MiR-146a changed significantly (P = 0.006) in both SD and DD groups compared to the control group. IGF1 (P = 0.001) and fat-free mass (P = 0.001) changed significantly in SD and DD groups compared to the control group, and also DD led to more significant increases in IGF1 and fat-free mass in comparison with SD. MiR-29 (P = 0.001) changed significantly in the DD group compared to the control group. The reduction of IL-1β, fat mass and insulin resistance was significant in SD and DD compared to the control group; DD showed more potent effects than the SD group on the fat mass (P = 0.001) and insulin resistance (P = 0.001). This study demonstrated that a combination of HIIT and resistance training could be practical for improving health-related outcomes in T2D. Our study indicated for the first time that training strength and HIIT on separate days appeared to be more effective to combat muscle atrophy and insulin resistance.

A systematic review was carried out until December 2018, which included the following databases: (a) PubMed; (b) SCOPUS; and (c) Web of Science. A combination of keywords relating to HRV and exercise was included during the research process. Initially, 570 articles were found, of which 7 were included in the sample. The 7 studies included in the present review tested 20 interventions and involved 245 participants. Interventions included aerobic training (n = 14), resistance training (n = 2), and concurrent training (n = 4). The results indicated that both aerobic and strength training and combined exercise can improve the parasympathetic modulation even with attenuated response of heart rate and blood pressure during and after physical exercise. Therefore, it is suggested that people with DS should practice some type of exercise to enhance their sympatho-vagal balance and to improve their health status.

News The databases searched were MedLine/PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane, Lilacs and Scielo. It was excluded during review process manuscripts that described: (i) non-experimental studies, (ii) interventions without measurement of hippocampus volume at baseline and post-intervention period, or (iii) interventions that were not compound by physical exercise. After removing duplicates, applying exclusion criteria, and checking reference lists, 13 studies were added to this review. The random effect model was used to the meta-analysis of hippocampus volume. Moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) was the most common PE adopted among the interventions, with most of them resulting in augmented hippocampus volume. Interventions based on concurrent training (resistance training + MICT) resulted in increase at same outcome in all cases, even though the target population was different. Regarding to meta-analysis, MICT [0.34 (0.10–0.58), P = 0.006] and resistance training (RT) [0.49 (0.09–0.89), P = 0.011] were associated with increased hippocampus volume. The heterogeneity was low in both MICT (I 2 = 12.9%) and RT (I 2 = 0.0%) interventions. Conclusion The results suggest that MICT, RT and CT could potentially augment hippocampus volume, being its practice encouraged to both prevent and treat individuals with neurodegenerative disease as Alzheimer.

Twenty participants aged 20-40 years with an expanded disability status Scale Level of 2 to 5 were selected. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: Experimental Group (age=36.1±2.2 years) and Control Group (age=34.3±5.4 years). The experimental group performed combination training that included aerobic and resistance exercises for eight weeks, three times a week, with an intensity of 40% to 55% heart rate reserve. The strength of knee flexor and extensor muscles, dynamic and static balance and resiliency level using Connor-Davidson were assessed. There were significant (p=0.05) changes in all measured parameters for the Intervention Group, no significant (p>0.05) changes were found from pre- to post-test in the Control Group. Eight weeks of combined training improved significantly (p=0.05) for muscle strength, balance and resiliency level in the Experimental Group when compared to the Control Group. Combined training may inevitably aid daily functioning and mental health in individuals with MS.

Two groups reduced their training to either 3 sessions.wk-1 (RT3) or 1 session.wk-1 (RT1), whereas the third group (IA) did no training. Measurement of muscular strength showed no decrement in any group over the 4 wk. In contrast, swim power was significantly decreased in all groups, reaching a mean change of -13.6% by week 4. Blood lactate measured after a standard 200-yard (183 m) front crawl swim increased by 1.8, 3.5, and 5.5 mM over the 4 wk in groups RT3, RT1 and IA, respectively. In group RT1, stroke rate measured during the 200-yard swim significantly increased from about 0.54 to 0.59 strokes.-1 while stroke distance significantly decreased from about 2.50 to 2.29 stroke-1 during the 4-wk period. Both stroke rate and stroke distance were maintained in group RT3 over the 4 wk of reduced training. Whereas VO2 max decreased significantly over the 4 wk in group RT1 (4.75 to 4.62 l.min-1), no change in maximal oxygen uptake was observed in group RT3. These results suggest that aerobic capacity is maintained over 4 wk of moderately reduced training in well-trained swimmers. Muscular strength was not diminished over 4 wk of reduced training or inactivity, but the ability to generate power during swimming was significantly reduced in all groups.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH208130&site=ehost-live"

Untrained women aged (mean plus/minus SD) 23 plus/minus 4 yr were matched and randomly placed in total- (TP, N = 17 and TH, N = 18) or upper-body resistance training (UP, N = 18 and UH, N = 15), field (FLD, N = 14), or aerobic training groups (AER, N = 11). Two periodized resistance training programs (with supplemental aerobic training) emphasized explosive exercise movements using 3- to 8-RM training loads (TP, UP), whereas the other two emphasized slower exercise movements using 8- to 12-RM loads (TH, UH). The FLD group performed plyometric and partner exercises. Subjects were tested for body composition, strength, power, endurance, maximal and repetitive box lift, 2-mile loaded run, and U.S. Army Physical Fitness Tests before (T0) and after 3 (T3) and 6 months of training (T6). For comparison, untrained men (N = 100) (MEN) were tested once. Specific training programs resulted in significant increases in body mass (TP), 1-RM squat (TP, TH, FLD), bench press (all except AER), high pull (TP), squat jump (TP, TH, FLD), bench throw (all except AER), squat endurance (all except AER), 1-RM box lift (all except aerobic), repetitive box lift (all), push-ups (all except AER), sit-ups (all except AER), and 2-mile run (all). Strength training improved physical performances of women over 6 months and adaptations in strength, power, and endurance were specific to the subtle differences (e.g., exercise choice and speeds of exercise movement) in the resistance training programs (strength/power vs strength/hypertrophy). Upper- and total-body resistance training resulted in similar improvements in occupational task performances, especially in tasks that involved upper-body musculature. Finally, gender differences in physical performance measures were reduced after resistance training in women, which underscores the importance of such training for physically demanding occupations.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-781561&site=ehost-live"

Twenty-seven male runners were divided into one of three groups: heavy resistance, explosive resistance or muscle endurance training. After 6 weeks of preparatory training, the groups underwent an 8-week resistance training programme as a supplement to endurance training. Before and after the 8-week training period, maximal strength (one-repetition maximum), electromyographic activity of the leg extensors, countermovement jump height, maximal speed in the maximal anaerobic running test, maximal endurance performance, maximal oxygen uptake ([Vdot]O2max), and running economy were assessed. Maximal strength improved in the heavy (P = 0.034, effect size ES = 0.38) and explosive resistance training groups (P = 0.003, ES = 0.67) with increases in leg muscle activation (heavy: P = 0.032, ES = 0.38; explosive: P = 0.002, ES = 0.77). Only the heavy resistance training group improved maximal running speed in the maximal anaerobic running test (P = 0.012, ES = 0.52) and jump height (P = 0.006, ES = 0.59). Maximal endurance running performance was improved in all groups (heavy: P = 0.005, ES = 0.56; explosive: P = 0.034, ES = 0.39; muscle endurance: P = 0.001, ES = 0.94), with small though not statistically significant improvements in [Vdot]O2max (heavy: ES = 0.08; explosive: ES = 0.29; muscle endurance: ES = 0.65) and running economy (ES in all groups < 0.08). All three modes of strength training used concurrently with endurance training were effective in improving treadmill running endurance performance. However, both heavy and explosive strength training were beneficial in improving neuromuscular characteristics, and heavy resistance training in particular contributed to improvements in high-intensity running characteristics. Thus, endurance runners should include heavy resistance training in their training programmes to enhance endurance performance, such as improving sprinting ability at the end of a race.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to determine the factors that affect the change in endurance performance after RMT in healthy subjects. Data sources: A computerized search was performed without language restriction in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL and references of original studies and reviews were searched for further relevant studies. Review methods: RMT studies with healthy individuals assessing changes in endurance exercise performance by maximal tests (constant load, time trial, intermittent incremental, conventional [non-intermittent] incremental) were screened and abstracted by two independent investigators. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify effects of subjects' fitness, type of RMT (inspiratory or combined inspiratory/expiratory muscle strength training, respiratory muscle endurance training), type of exercise test, test duration and type of sport (rowing, running, swimming, cycling) on changes in performance after RMT. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed to determine the effect of RMT on endurance performance in those studies providing the necessary data. Results: The multiple linear regression analysis including 46 original studies revealed that less fit subjects benefit more from RMT than highly trained athletes (6.0% per 10 mL • kg-1 • min-1 decrease in maximal oxygen uptake, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8, 10.2%; p=0.005) and that improvements do not differ significantly between inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle endurance training (p=0.208), while combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength training seems to be superior in improving performance, although based on only 6 studies (+ 12.8% compared with inspiratory muscle strength training, 95% CI 3.6, 22.0%; p=0.006). Furthermore, constant load tests (+16%, 95% CI 10.2, 22.9%) and intermittent incremental tests (+18.5%, 95% CI 10.8, 26.3%) detect changes in endurance performance better than conventional incremental tests (both p<0.001) with no difference between time trials and conventional incremental tests (p=0.286). With increasing test duration, improvements in performance are greater (+0.4% per minute test duration, 95% CI 0.1, 0.6%; p=0.011) and the type of sport does not influence the magnitude of improvements (all p>0.05). The metaanalysis, performed on eight controlled trials revealed a significant improvement in performance after RMT, which was detected by constant load tests, time trials and intermittent incremental tests, but not by conventional incremental tests. Conclusion: RMT improves endurance exercise performance in healthy individuals with greater improvements in less fit individuals and in sports of longer durations. The two most common types of RMT (inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle endurance training) do not differ significantly in their effect, while combined inspiratory/expiratory strength training might be superior. Improvements are similar between different types of sports. Changes in performance can be detected by constant load tests, time trials and intermittent incremental tests only. Thus, all types of RMT can be used to improve exercise performance in healthy subjects but care must be taken regarding the test used to investigate the improvements.

Exercise training and increased fitness promote positive changes in body composition and improve insulin sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of sequence order of combined strength and endurance training on new adiposity indices: visceral adiposity index (VAI), body adiposity index (BAI) and waist to hip ratio (WHtR) in overweight elderly women. METHODS: Forty overweight elderly women (age range: 60.34 ± 0.82 years old) were selected purposefully and randomly assigned into four groups: endurance, then strength (E - > S) ( n = 9 ), strength, then endurance (S = ⁣ > E) ( n = 10 ), alternative concurrent training (ACT) ( n = 12 ), and control ( n = 9 ) groups. Training was performed three times per week for eight weeks. Endurance training performed on a cycle ergometer (intensity: 60–88% MHR) and strength training included several selected exercises targeting upper and lower body (intensity: 40–75 1RM, 8–18 repeat). RESULTS: The results showed that the amount of weight, BMI, body fat percentage, BAI and WHtR have significantly decreased in E + S, S + E and ACT experimental groups ( P < 0.05). No significant differences were found in VAI variable and triglyceride with sequence order of E + S and S + E, but after sequence order of ACT a significant decrease was seen in both variables ( P ⩾ 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the three combined training groups for the mentioned variables ( P ⩾ 0.05). CONCLUSION: Sequence does not seem to play a role in the positive effect on current adiposity indices of the investigated training programs.

Results Aerobic training and combined training showed significant differences in fat percentage (−2.6%Δ, −4.2%Δ, and 0.2%Δ, P = 0.044 respectively) and fat mass (−5.5%Δ, −5.7%Δ, and 1.1%Δ, P = 0.034 respectively) compared to the control group. Considering the waist circumference, there was a significant difference only between the combined training and control group (−1.3%Δ, −2.6%Δ, and 0.5%Δ, P = 0.048 respectively). Aerobic training and combined training groups showed significant differences in total cholesterol (−7.9%Δ, −9.7%Δ, and 0.9%Δ, P = 0.022 respectively), triglyceride (−5.8%Δ, −6.9%Δ, and 2.0%Δ, respectively, P = 0.012), atherogenic index (−13.5%Δ, −16.0%Δ, and 2.3%Δ, P = 0.000 respectively) and Beck Depression Inventory score (−26.2%Δ, −24.7%Δ, and 8.7%Δ, P = 0.047 respectively) compared to the control group. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that both training methods could be used for loosing body weight, fat mass and fat percentage for middle-aged women. Although the combined training seems a little more efficient, aerobic training is also practically easier in order to control and maintain in a large scale training groups.

However, the correct order of combined training to promote PEH is still unclear. Objective: To verify the effect of the order of the aerobic component in combined training on PEH among hypertensive elderly women. Methods: Randomized clinical trial of 24 elderly hypertensive women allocated to three training groups: Group 1 - Aerobic + Strength Training (AT + ST), Group 2 - Strength + Aerobic Training (ST + AT) and Group 3 - Aerobic + Strength + Aerobic Training (AT + ST + AT). Participants underwent AT at 60% heart rate reserve intensity for 30 minutes and ST with four exercises in three sets of 12 repetitions at 60% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) also for 30 minutes. The training involved 24 sessions (three times a week).Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured in all groups at time points before and after each session, and the mean BP (MBP) was calculated. Results: The variables analyzed did not differ significantly between groups in either the pre- or post-training period. MBP showed a significant reduction only in G1. However, G3 had a greater effect on all the variables analyzed. Conclusion: Combined training with an aerobic component (G3) generated a significant post-exercise hypotensive effect over 24 sessions, and is indicated for elderly hypertensive women.

Thirty-one male and female rowers were randomly assigned to a group (n=10)that did not intentionally control their breathing during rowing training, a group (n=11) that controlled their breathing at 2 breaths per stroke during training (2:1) and a group (n=10) that performed 1 breath per stroke (1:1) during training. The program included 8 weeks of stationary rowing (4d·wk-1) and strength training (2d·wk-1) that was equated between groups. Variables were measured during 3 different trials of submaximal rowing exercise that was performed using the 3 different breathing patterns (uncontrolled, 2:1 and 1:1) and during a maximal 2000-m simulated rowing race, before and after training. HR and V̇CO2 were lower (p<0.05) during submaximal exercise after training regardless of which breathing frequency was used. Submaximal V̇O2 at a breathing rate of 2:1 and 1:1 strokes per breath (p<0.05) and submaximal V̇E at a frequency of 2:1 were decreased after training in all groups (p<0.05). Tidal volume was higher during the first half of the maximal 2000-m simulated rowing race after training only in the training group that controlled breathing at a rate of 1:1 (p<0.05). These results indicate that controlling breathing at 1 or 2 breaths per rowing stroke during submaximal exercise improves rowing economy after training. Ventilation was also lower after training when a frequency of 2 breaths per stroke was used during submaximal exercise. Training with a breathing frequency of 1 breath per stroke resulted in a higher tidal volume during the first half of the maximal 2000-m simulated rowing race. Therefore, the use of breathing entrainment during exercise in combination with training can improve some physiological responses to submaximal and maximal rowing exercise.

Subjects volunteered to be in either an exercise (Ex; N = 17) or control (Con; N = 10) group. Con subjects were 34 percent less active in winter than in summer; Ex subjects maintained their summer activity level on exercise days in winter. Initial, intermediate (20 wk), and final (50 wk) measurements were made for isokinetic knee extension/flexion strength; VO2max and morphological measurements from a muscle biopsy were made at the initial and final times only. both groups gained in leg strength (Ex =plus 6.5 percent; Con= plus 7.8 percent; P less than or equal to 0.05) during the summer; in the winter the Ex group maintained leg strength and the Con group declined 12.2 percent (P less than or equal to 0.05).

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise training on male factor infertility and seminal markers of inflammation. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, CISCOM, Springer, Elsevier Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, PEDro, Ovid (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO), Sport Discus, Orbis, CINAHL, Web of Science, ProQuest, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that analyzed the impacts of selected types of exercise interventions on markers of male reproductive function and reproductive performance. Study Selection: A total of 336 records were identified, of which we included 7 trials reporting on 2641 fertile and infertile men in the systematic review and network meta-analysis. Level of Evidence: Level 1 (because this is a systematic review of RCTs). Data Extraction: The data included the study design, participant characteristics, inclusion and exclusion, intervention characteristics, outcome measures, and the main results of the study. Results: The results of network meta-analysis showed that, compared with a nonintervention control group, the top-ranking interventions for pregnancy rate were for combined aerobic and resistance training (CET) (relative risk [RR] = 27.81), moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) (RR = 26.67), resistance training (RT) (RR = 12.54), high-intensity continuous training (HICT) (RR = 5.55), and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) (RR = 4.63). While the top-ranking interventions for live birth rate were for MICT (RR = 10.05), RT (RR = 4.92), HIIT (RR = 4.38), CET (RR = 2.20), and HICT (RR = 1.55). Also, with the following order of effectiveness, 5 training strategies were significantly better at improving semen quality parameters (CET > MICT > HICT > RT > HIIT), seminal markers of oxidative stress (CET > MICT > HIIT > HICT > RT), seminal markers of inflammation (CET > MICT > HIIT > RT > HICT), as well as measures of body composition and VO2max (CET > HICT > MICT > HIIT > RT). Conclusion: The review recommends that the intervention with the highest probability of being the best approach out of all available options for improving the male factor infertility was for CET.

Sedentary overweight/obese insulin-resistant women (age = 33.5 ± 6.5 yr; body mass index = 29.9 ± 3.7 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to a triweekly HIIT program (HIIT; n = 18) or resistance training (RT; n = 17). Anthropometry (body mass, fat mass, muscle mass, waist circumference, and skinfold thickness), cardiovascular (blood pressure), metabolic [fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], as well as muscle strength, and endurance performance covariables were measured before and after 12 wk in both intervention groups. The interindividual variability to exercise training of the subjects was categorized as responders and NR using as cut points two times the typical error of measurement in mean outcomes. After intervention, significant reduction in waist circumference, skinfold thicknesses, fat mass, blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR (P < 0.05) were identified to HIIT and RT group, respectively. Both HIIT and RT groups exhibited a significant decrease in the endurance performance, whereas only RT exhibited increased muscle strength. Significant differences in the NR prevalence between the HIIT and RT groups were identified for a decrease in fat mass (HIIT 33.3% vs. RT 70.5%; P = 0.028), muscle mass (HIIT 100% vs. RT 52.9%; P = 0.001), and tricipital skinfold (HIIT 5.5% vs. RT 29.4%; P < 0.041). For diastolic blood pressure, significant differences were observed in the NR prevalence between the HIIT and RT groups (55.5% vs. 94.1; P = 0.009). However, there were no differences in the NR prevalence between HIIT and RT for decreasing fasting glucose. Twelve weeks of HIIT and RT have similar effects and NR prevalence to improve glucose control variables; however, there is different NR prevalence in other anthropometric, cardiovascular, strength, and endurance performance measurements in insulin-resistant women. These findings were displayed with a similar time investment per week of 114 vs. 108 min, respectively, to HIIT and RT. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The effects and prevalence of nonresponders (NR) to improve glucose control variables have predominately been reported by endurance training. A uniqueness of the present study was to examine the NR prevalence in women with insulin resistance after high-intensity interval (HIIT) and resistance training (RT). This study demonstrates that 12 wk of HIIT and RT have similar effects and NR prevalence to improve glucose control variables. However, significantly different NR prevalence were observed in other anthropometric, cardiovascular, strength, and endurance performance measurements.

The subjects exercised at 40 to 50 percent of their 1-RM for each weight station. Workloads for the aerobic stations were assigned based on the workload needed to elicit 75 to 85 percent of the maximal heart rate reached during the VO2max test. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA with significance established at p is less than 0.05. The exercise group had significant increases in VO2max, upper body strength, and lower body strength, and significant decreases in skinfold sum and percent body fat.

Methods: A total of 76 adolescents (16.1 [1.1] y, n = 44 female) were randomized into groups of moderate-intensity continuous training combined with resistance training (MICT + RT), high-intensity interval training combined with resistance training (HIIT + RT), or control. The training sessions were performed twice weekly for 12 weeks. The outcomes evaluated included body fat percentage, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, glycated hemoglobin, insulin resistance index, blood pressure, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), and cardiometabolic risk Z score. Results: The intervention groups presented a significant reduction in the cardiometabolic risk Z score after 12 weeks of the combined exercise program. In relation to the cardiometabolic risk Z score between groups, the HIIT + RT group presented a significant intervention effect when compared with the control group (Cohen d = 0.23; P <.05). Significant intervention effects were found when comparing the MICT + RT and control groups for body fat percentage, high-density lipoprotein, and VO2peak. Between the HIIT + RT and control groups, significant intervention effects were found for body fat percentage, blood pressure, and VO2peak. There were not significant differences between the HIIT + RT and MICT + RT groups. Conclusion: Twelve weeks of HIIT + RT and MICT + RT were effective in significantly reducing the cardiometabolic risk in these adolescents.

Studies showed that two weeks of betaine supplementation can enhance power, muscular strength and endurance. Both of resistance training and plyometric training can enhance the exercise performance. Long term and higher dosage of betaine supplementation combine with training may had more benefits on exercise performance. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of 6 weeks of betaine supplementation combined with a compound training, consisting of velocity based resistance training and plyometric training, on the performance of 20 m sprint, counter movement jump, overhead medicine throwing, as well as maximal muscular strength of bench press, half squat, shoulder press and sumo deadlift. METHODS: Fourteen collegiate athletes were recruited. The maximal muscular strength of subjects were measured before the intervention. Subjects were divided into betaine or placebo groups (7 in each group) to consume 5 grams of betaine or methylcellulose per day for 6 weeks by a double blind design. Subjects also conducted the compound training twice per week during the supplementation periods. The training program included 4 exercises of velocity based resistance training and 2 exercises of plyometric training. The exercise performance were determined before and after 6-week of supplementation. Data were analyzed by a two-way mixed-design analysis of variance to compare the variables between groups and time points. RESULTS: The performance of 20 m sprint and maximal strength of bench press and sumo deadlift significantly better than pre-intervention in both betaine and placebo groups after 6 weeks of intervention. Moreover, distance of overhead medicine throwing and maximal strength of half squat in betaine group significantly increased after intervention [6.87 ± 0.66 vs 6.21 ± 0.67 m (p < 0.05), and 133.14 ± 22.08 vs 121.00 ± 17.61 kg (p < 0.05), respectively]. However, there were no significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Six weeks of betaine supplementation combined with the velocity based resistance training and plyometric training twice per week tend to enhance the power of upper limb and strength of lower limb.

Fifty-two untrained but healthy female students were randomised to an 8-week endurance training, an 8-week resistance training, or a wait list control group. Before and after the training intervention, we assessed the groups' cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max test), self-reported life stress, coping strategies and cardiovascular reactivity to and recovery from a standardised laboratory stressor. Both endurance and resistance training programmes caused physiological adaptation in terms of increased VO2max after the intervention. For stress and coping parameters, participants in the training groups improved cardiovascular recovery from stress and reported having less stress in their everyday life after the intervention than participants in the control group, while the two training groups did not differ from each other. We did not find any significant differences in heart rate reactivity and coping strategies between the study groups. These results partly support that exercise training has stress-reducing benefits regardless of the type of exercise. Both endurance and resistance exercise activities may be effectively used to improve stress regulation competence while having less impact on changing specific coping strategies.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a 6-week progressive and combined training program on muscular strength and cardiovascular endurance of young adults with moderate global delay. Three, one-hour sessions per week, for 6 weeks, involved full body resistance and cardiorespiratory training. A 10 maximum-repetition (RM) seated chest and leg press performance, as well as Legers 20m shuttle run were administered at the pre-, mid- and post- times. The progressive training principle was applied after the mid-test. The results showed significant improvements in muscular strength and cardiorespiratory endurance confirming that combined and progressive training protocol resulted in faster gains as compared to past approaches that involved programs that were less intense but longer in duration.

However, it remains unclear whether beneficial effects can also be induced using alternating instead of blocked BT and PT exercise sequences. Thus, we examined the effects of a blocked versus an alternated sequence of BT and PT on physical performance in trained individuals. Methods: Twenty young soccer players (13 years) were randomly assigned to a blocked (n = 10) or an alternated (n = 10) intervention group. Both groups trained balance and plyometric exercises for six weeks (two sessions/week). The exercises were conducted in a blocked (three weeks of BT followed by three weeks of PT) or an alternated sequence (weekly change of BT and PT). Assessment of pre- and post-training performance included measures of balance, muscle power, speed, and agility. Results: Mainly significant main effects of Test (i.e., pre- to post-test improvements) were observed for the Y-balance test (p ≤ 0.014, 1.3 ≤ Cohen's d ≤ 1.81), the squat jump (p = 0.029, d = 1.36), the countermovement jump (p = 0.002, d = 2.21), the drop jump (p = 0.004, d = 1.96), the split times/total time over 15-m sprinting (p ≤ 0.001, 2.02 ≤ d ≤ 3.08), and the figure-T agility run (p < 0.001, d = 3.80). Further, tendencies toward significant Test x Group interactions were found for several items of the Y-balance test and for SJ height in favor of the blocked BTPT group. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the combined training of balance and plyometric exercises is effective to improve proxies of physical performance in youth soccer players. In addition, there is a limited advantage in some parameters of balance and muscle power for the blocked as compared to the alternated sequence of BT and PT.

Although previous reports showed that resistance training is feasible and effective, we hypothesized that a more intense exercise program would also be feasible, but more beneficial than low- to moderate-intensity training programs. We aimed to examine the effects of an exercise program combining high-intensity resistance exercises and moderate-intensity aerobic exercises in young patients undergoing treatment for ALL. A quasi-experimental study was conducted. The patients (n = 6; 5-16 years of age) underwent a 12-week intra-hospital training program involving high-intensity strength exercises and aerobic exercise at 70% of the peak oxygen consumption. At baseline and after 12 weeks, we assessed sub-maximal strength (10 repetition-maximum), quality of life and possible adverse effects. A significant improvement was observed in the sub maximal strength for bench press (71%), lat pull down (50%), leg press (73%) and leg extension (64%) as a result of the training (p < 0.01). The parents' evaluations of their children's quality of life revealed an improvement in fatigue and general quality of life, but the children's self-reported quality of life was not changed. No adverse effects occurred. A 12-week in-hospital training program including high-intensity resistance exercises promotes marked strength improvements in patients during the maintenance phase of the treatment for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia without side-effects. Parents' evaluations of their children revealed an improvement in the quality of life. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=82574133&site=ehost-live"

The testing was conducted before (PRE) and after (POST) 10 weeks of resistance training (3 sets of 10 repetitions with 80% of the subject's 1RM performed 3 times per week) on the LE and BP exercises. Body weight, FFM, LE 1RM, LE END, BP 1RM, and BP END increased (p < 0.05), whereas %fat decreased (p < 0.05) from PRE to POST for both the TEST and PLAC groups. Peak power and MP, however, increased for the TEST group, but not for the PLAC group. These results suggested that the creatine-, amino acid-, and protein-containing drink provided no additional benefits when compared with carbohydrates alone for eliciting changes in body composition, strength, and muscular endurance after a 10-week resistance training period.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a maintenance resistance training program on muscular strength in children in a PE setting. Seventy-five children, 10-12 years of age, from four different 6th grade PE classes were cluster-randomized into either an experimental group (EG=38) or a control group (CG=37). After an eight-week development program and a four-week detraining period, the EG completed a four-week maintenance program once a week. The program included two circuits of eight stations of 15/45 to 35/25 seconds of work/rest. Abdominal and arm muscular endurance and explosive strength of the legs were measured before and after the development program and after the maintenance program. After the development and maintenance programs abdominal and arm muscular endurance were higher in EG (p<.05), while they did not change in CG (p>.05). No significant differences were found between groups in the legs' explosive strength (p>.05). The present results showed that a resistance program carried out once a week can maintain muscular endurance of schoolchildren. These results could help PE teachers design programs that permit students to maintain fit strength levels.

In literature, mainly endurance training is recommended. Because of the specific symptoms (e.g., muscle atrophy, dyspnea, low testosterone levels) and the de-conditioning of these patients, resistance training might meet the demands of a COPD-exercise-therapy rather than endurance training. The aim of this research project was to evaluate the efficiency of strength training on various COPD-relevant parameters. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with moderate to severe COPD (12 male, 16 female) were randomized and divided into a treatment and a control group. The patients in the treatment group underwent a hypertrophic maximal strength training for 12 weeks, initially twice, then 3 times a week for 60 to 120 min. Results: The FEV[sub1] performance (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) showed a significant increase (p = .01) of 5.3%. Whereas in the daily peak-flow measurement, there was no significant change in both groups, a trend towards improvement of this parameter could be found in the treatment group by 20 L. The performance on the ergo cycle showed a significant improvement (p < .001) of the treatment group of 18.7% (21.9 W). The results of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire also showed a significant improvement (p < .05) of the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in the treatment group. A change of the HRQL in the control group was not found. Conclusions: These data support the hypotheses that a short-term, high-intensity strength training program is suitable to improve pulmonary function and performance measurements of patients with moderate to severe COPD. These changes lead to an improved performance of daily activities and general well-being. The conclusion can be drawn that hypertrophic maximal strength training is preferable for a COPD-specific exercise therapy and offers new treatment...

However, the effects of a rugby union pre-season in professional athletes are currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of a 4-week pre-season on 33 professional rugby union players. Bench press and box squat increased moderately (13.6 kg, 90% confidence limits ±2.9 kg and 17.6 ± 8.0 kg, respectively) over the training phase. Small decreases in bench throw (70.6 ± 53.5 W), jump squat (280.1 ± 232.4 W), and fat mass (1.4 ± 0.4 kg) were observed. In addition, small increases were seen in fat-free mass (2.0 ± 0.6 kg) and flexed upper-arm girth (0.6 ± 0.2 cm), while moderate increases were observed in mid-thigh girth (1.9 ± 0.5 cm) and perception of fatigue (0.6 ± 0.4 units). Increases in strength and body composition were observed in elite rugby union players after 4 weeks of intensive pre-season training, but this may have been the result of a return to fitness levels prior to the off-season. Decreases in power may reflect high training volumes and increases in perceived of fatigue.

A total of 53 participants were pair-matched according to preliminary maximal aerobic capacity (...) Bruce protocol assessment into level-grade (SIT0) or 6% incline (SIT6) groups. This 12-week intervention consisted of 3 CET sessions per week. Sprint interval protocol consisted of 2 (weeks 1-6) then 3 (weeks 7-12) sets of three 40-second sprints at specific intensities to evoke responses equivalent to 95% of age-predicted maximal heart rate interspersed with 20 seconds of rest; with 1 minute of passive recovery between sets. An undulating periodization model consisting of lifts such as the back squat and bench press constituted the RET component. Protocol order alternated each session. Posttraining revealed significant improvements in both SIT0 and SIT6 (p ≤ 0.05) for ... (2.11 ± 0.390 to 2.29 ± 0.382 L⋅min-1; 2.03 ± 0.382 to 2.09 ± 0.561 L⋅min-1), Tmax (490.5 ± 102.3 to 542.7 ± 81.5 seconds; 503.2 ± 75.4 to 541.8 ± 77.0 seconds), and Vmax (5.1 ± 0.92 miles per hour [MPH] to 5.9 ± 0.90 MPH; 4.3 ± 0.68 MPH to 4.9 ± 0.64 MPH), respectively. No significant between-group interactions were detected for any of the variables. Our SIT-based CET intervention represents an effective strategy to induce significant cardiovascular adaptations in older women as evident by aerobic capacity improvements, beneficial to overall health and critical for functionality into old age; an important concern for aging women.

Twenty-eight competitive male rugby players (mean age = 19.53 ± 1.3 years) were subjects in this study. All subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups: (a) Accentuated eccentric loading combined with plyometric training group (AECT, n = 14) ; and ( b) Traditional complex training group (TCT, n = 14). The subjects were tested for strength, peak power, speed, and agility prior to the training and after the 6th-week of training. Both the AECT and the TCT groups performed identical training except that the AECT group used a weight-release device attached to a barbell loaded with plates, while the TCT group used just the barbell loaded with plates. Statistical analyses revealed significant (P<0.05) between-group differences after training. The results showed that the AECT group significantly increased strength and agility compared to the TCT group (P<0.05). Both the AECT and the TCT groups resulted in a significant increase in strength, power, speed, and agility compared to the pre-test (P<0.05). Hence, accentuated eccentric loading combined with plyometric training is better than traditional complex training for developing strength and agility.

However, if the athlete has any form of increased airway resistance or disease athletic performance will be negatively affected. The objective of the present study was to assess the evidence with a critical review and meta-analysis on the relevant studies that evaluated the effects of aerobic and concurrent aerobic and resistance training on effort- or muscle-dependant spirometry parameters in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The database of exercise and COPD-related articles was compiled from Sport discus, Ebscohost, Pubmed and by utilizing previously cited articles. Articles selected were based on: utilization of aerobic and/or a combination of resistance and aerobic training; age of sampled subjects between 45 and 75 years; if both the mean and standard deviation values of the pre- and post-tests were reported in order to calculate an effect size. The findings revealed that aerobic training had a small effect on FEV1 (%) (r = 0.2082), FEV1 (l) (r = 0.1651), FVC (%) (r = 0.2534), FEF 25-75 (l) (r = 0.1015) and FEV1/FVC (%) (r = 0.1015) and a medium effect on FVC (l) (r = 0.3977). However, no studies were found to have an effect on FEF 25-75 (%) (r = 0.0405) and MVV (l.min-1) (r = 0.0497). Concurrent training resulted in small effects on FVC (l) (r = 0.1919), FVC (%) (r = 0.2543), FEF 25-75 (%) (r = 0.1156) and FEV1/FVC (%) (r = 0.1098) and had no effect on FEV1 (%) (r = 0.0567), FEV1 (l) (r = 0.0845) and FEF 25-75 (l) (r = 0.0224). No studies utilizing concurrent training reported an effect on MVV. Reliable conclusions can be drawn concerning the use of aerobic training in clinical practice to improve athletic performance in athletes with COPD, while concurrent training may prove to be a viable adjunct to aerobic training due to its positive effects on several effort-dependent variables. However, due to the small number of studies focusing on the effect of concurrent training on COPD effort-dependant variables, there is a need for large-scale, good quality methodological trials in order to address the issues raised in the present study and to clarify and confirm the conclusions of this study.

The run/walk in treadmill program had duration of 23 min in a moderate to high intensity. The resistance training consisted of 2 sets of 10 reps for the following exercises: lat pull down, leg press, chest press, shoulder press, and sit-ups. The resistance training was performed with dumbbells and pulley machines. Before and after intervention, several evaluations were conducted: body composition by Slaughter's equations, aerobic capacity by ergospirometry, and muscle endurance by push-up and sit-up tests. Significant increase in the fat free mass (P=0.01) was observed throughout the training period. Although the total body weight increased (P=0.02), no change was found in fat mass (P=0.24). Maximum oxygen uptake (P=0.03) and abdominal muscle endurance (P=0.04) were also significantly improved. Thus, the findings indicate that a supervised exercise program combining aerobic and resistance exercises significantly improved body composition, aerobic capacity, and abdominal muscle endurance in adolescents with cystic fibrosis.

Forty-one individuals of both sexes with Down syndrome (age, 15.51±2.70 y) were divided into three groups: CG (control group) with 10 participants; ATG group (aerobic training group) with 16 participants; and RTG (resistance training group) with 15 participants. The training program lasted 12 weeks, with frequency of 3 days a week for ATG and two RTG, and duration of 50 minutes per session. Aerobic training consisted of exercise on a treadmill/bike at intensity between 50 and 70% of reserve heart rate, while resistance training was composed of nine exercises performed on three sets of 12 maximum repetitions for each exercise. Aerobic and resistance training were not able to increase peak oxygen uptake. However, there was an increase in the maximum ventilation and a decrease of submaximal heart rate only for groups who participated in the training program. Moreover, the aerobic group increased work capacity after training. Training programs led to an improvement in cardiac efficiency during submaximal activities and increased maximum ventilation, which demonstrates a cardiorespiratory improvement ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=126545249&site=ehost-live"

Here, we test the hypothesis that aerobic training lowers cardiovascular sympathetic responses to and speeds recovery from challenge. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial contrasting aerobic versus strength training on indices of cardiac (pre-ejection period, PEP) and vascular (low-frequency blood pressure variability, LF-BPV) sympathetic responses to and recovery from psychological and orthostatic challenge in 149 young, healthy, sedentary adults. Aerobic and strength training did not alter PEP or LF-BPV reactivity to or recovery from challenge. These findings, from a large randomized, controlled trial using an intent-to-treat design, show that moderate aerobic exercise training has no effect on PEP and LF-BPV reactivity to or recovery from psychological or orthostatic challenge. In healthy young adults, the cardioprotective effects of exercise training are unlikely to be mediated by changes in sympathetic activity.

However, ST requires specialized equipment and environments that hinder the practice of the elderly population; thus, elastic devices can help in the practice of ST because they are easy to apply. Objective: To evaluate the effects of CT on the functional capacity (FC) of older adults after 8 weeks of intervention. Methods: Participants were randomly allocated to the combined training group (CTG) or control group (CG). The CTG performed, with 3 weekly sessions, a TA (70–85% of the heart rate reserve) followed by ST with elastic tubes (6 exercises; 2 × 15 repetitions) with load progression through the perception of effort scale, color, and elastic extension. Before and after the intervention, six FC tests and a maximum isometric strength test of the knee extensors were evaluated. Two-way ANOVA was applied, with Bonferroni post hoc, adopting a p < 0.05. Results: Twenty-two older people participated in the study (CTG, 62.91 ± 5.88; CG, 62.70 ± 5.29), of both sexes (CTG, 8/4; CG, 6/4).

All participants received dietary counselling with a maximum daily energy deficit of 250 kcal. Cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption) was measured by indirect calorimetry using a graded treadmill exercise test. Musculoskeletal fitness was measured using the 2003 Canadian Physical Activity Fitness and Lifestyle Appraisal tests (hand grip, push-ups, partial curl-ups, sit and reach, and vertical jump). Muscular strength was assessed using an 8-repetition maximum test on the bench press, seated row, and leg press machines. A greater increase in peak oxygen consumption in the aerobic exercise group (30.6 ± 0.6 to 33.4 ± 0.7 mLO2/kg/min) was measured relative to the control group (30.6 ± 0.5 to 30.9 ± 0.7 mLO2/kg/min) ( p = 0.002). Similarly, the number of partial curl-ups increased in the aerobic group (19 ± 1 to 23 ± 1) while no differences were measured in the control group (19 ± 1 to 20 ± 1) ( p = 0.015). Increases in muscular strength and number of push-ups were greatest in the resistance group versus the control and combined groups versus the aerobic group ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, aerobic training had the strongest effect on cardiorespiratory fitness, while resistance and combined training improved both muscular strength and endurance more than control and aerobic training alone, respectively, in adolescents with obesity.

Thirty-one older, male recreational golfers (M age=65.1 years) participated in a controlled study during the Winter and Spring of 2001. The experimental group consisted of 19 golfers and the control group consisted of 12 golfers. The 8-week program was attended at least 3 times per week by all 19 golfers. Each exercise session consisted of: (a) 15 minutes of treadmill walking or stationary cycling at 60%-80% of maximal predicted heart rate for cardiovascular endurance; (b) Weight training consisting of 1 set of 12 repetitions using approximately 80% of measured 10-RM strength on 10 separate Universal weight machines; (c) Flexibility training including 8 static and 2 dynamic stretches; and, (d) Swinging of a weighted golf club 10 times slowly. This study demonstrated that an 8-week conditioning program resulted in improvements for all ten measurements of muscular strength, range of motion improvements for most upper body and trunk measurements, but not those measuring the hip, and cardiovascular endurance, as measured by estimated VO2max. In addition, the 8-week conditioning program elicited an improvement in maximal club head speed. The results did not support an improvement in perceptions of physical function or golf-related performance as measured by the Physical Function Scale, the Golf Performance Scale, or the Golf-Related Pain and Soreness Scale. In addition, this study determined that the club head speed of older, male recreational golfers is most influenced by cardiovascular endurance, upper and lower body strength, and magnitude of trunk rotation.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-888478&site=ehost-live"

Methods: One repetition maximal bench press (1RMBP), jumping explosive strength, power-load relationship of the leg and arm extensor muscles, 5- and 15-m sprint running time, endurance running, and handball throwing velocity (standing and three-step running throw) were assessed on four times (T1, T2, T3, and T4), during a 45-wk season. Individual volumes and intensities of training and competition were quantified for 11 activities. Results: From T1 to T3, significant increases occurred in free fatty mass (1.4 %), 1RMBP (1.9 %), standing throwing velocity (6.5 %), and three-step throwing velocity (6.2 %). No significant changes were observed throughout the season in endurance running and explosive strength-related variables. Significant correlations (P &lt; 0.05-0.01) were observed between strength training time and changes in standing throwing velocity as well as between high-intensity endurance training time and changes in endurance running. In addition, linear inverse relationships were observed between low-intensity endurance training time and changes in muscle power output of the lower extremities. Conclusion: The handball season resulted in significant increases in maximal and specific strength of the upper-extremity but not in the lower-extremity actions. The correlations observed suggest that training time at low intensity should be given less attention, whereas the training stimuli for high-intensity endurance running and leg strength training should be given more careful attention in the full training season program.

Methods: Seven children (four boys, three girls; age: 5.1 +/- 1.2 yr, body mass: 24.0 +/- 5.8 kg, height: 114.6 +/- 7.7 cm) in the maintenance phase of treatment against ALL performed three sessions per week for 16 wk of resistance (one set of 8-15 repetitions of 11 exercises) and aerobic training (30 min at &gt; 70 % HRmax) followed by 20 wk of detraining where no structured exercise program was performed. Before training, after training, and after detraining, a treadmill test determining V[spacing dot above]O2peak and ventilator threshold (VT), muscular strength (6RM), functional mobility (timed up and down stairs test, time up and go 3-m and 10-m tests), passive and dynamic ankle range of motion, and self-reported quality of living were determined. Results: After training, significant increases in VO2peak, VT, upper- and lower-body muscular strength, and all measures of functional mobility were shown (P &lt; 0.05). Muscular strength was well maintained (significantly greater than before training and no significant decrease from after training) during detraining, whereas VO2peak, VT, and functional mobility (not significantly different from before training but no significant decrease from after training) were only partially retained. Conclusion: Young children in the maintenance phase of treatment against ALL can safely perform both aerobic and resistance training. Training results in significant increases in measures of aerobic fitness, strength, and functional mobility. During detraining, strength and functional mobility are well maintained, whereas VO2peak and VT are partially maintained.

Twenty basketball players and 18 control boys participated in the study. Basketball players participated both in their school's physical education program and in a children's basketball team training program. Controls participated only in their school's physical education program. All subjects were tested every 6 months (18 months total, 111/2, 12, 121/2, 13 years old) for O2max, peak torque values of the quadriceps and ham- strings at 180 and 300°·s-1 and range of motion of the knee and hip joints. Body fat percentage was assessed at the beginning and the end of the experimental period. Results showed that the basketball group had lower heart rate values in all ages and higher O2 values in the initial test compared with the control in submaximal intensity. The O2max was altered in both groups on the final test, when compared to the initial test. However, the basketball group had a higher O2max on each of the 6-month follow-up measurements, compared to the control group (p > 0.001). At the end of the 18-month follow-up period no significant differences were observed in isokinetic strength and joint mobility of the lower limbs between the 2 groups. On the contrary, the boys of the trained group had significantly lower percentage body fat values, compared to controls. In conclusion, regular basketball training increased aerobic power and decreased body fat percentage of prepubescent boys, while it did not affect muscle strength and joint mobility of the lower limbs. The major implication suggested by the findings of the present study is that, in order to improve the basic physical components, specific training procedures should be incorporated during the basketball training sessions. It is recommended that all children should be involved in some type of cardiovascular and resistance training program.

This study investigates the effectiveness of BFR training relative to other forms of training on muscle strength, hypertrophy, and endurance. Data sources: We performed systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed and assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Main results: We included 53 randomized controlled trials with 31 included in meta-analyses. For muscular strength comparing low-intensity BFR (LI-BFR) training with high-intensity resistance training (HIRT), the pooled mean difference (MD) for 1 repetition maximum was 5.34 kg (95% CI, 2.58-8.09; P < 0.01) favoring HIRT. When comparing LI-BFR training with HIRT for torque, the MD was 6.35 N·m (95% CI, 0.5-12.3; P = 0.04) also favoring HIRT. However, comparing LI-BFR with low-intensity resistance training (LIRT) for torque, there was a MD of 9.94 N·m (95% CI, 5.43-14.45; P < 0.01) favoring BFR training. Assessing muscle hypertrophy, the MD in cross-sectional area was 0.96 cm2 (95% CI, 0.21-1.7; P = 0.01) favoring pooled BFR training compared with nonocclusive training. Assessing endurance, V̇ o 2 maximum demonstrated a greater mean increase of 0.37 mL/kg/min (95% CI, −0.97 to 3.17; P = 0.64) in BFR endurance training compared with endurance training alone. Conclusion: Blood flow restriction training produced increases in muscular strength, hypertrophy, and endurance. Comparing LI-BFR training with HIRT, HIRT was a significantly better training modality for increasing muscle hypertrophy and strength. However, LI-BFR was superior when compared with a similar low-intensity protocol. Blood flow restriction training is potentially beneficial to those unable to tolerate the high loads of HIRT; however, better understanding of its risk to benefit ratio is needed before clinical application. Level of evidence: Level 1. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=159061627&site=ehost-live"

Recent research has aimed to determine the effect of aerobic exercise with BFR on aerobic fitness and performance, with conflicting results. This review aimed to systematically identify and assess studies that have combined BFR with aerobic exercise in humans, establishing its effect on aerobic fitness and performance. Five databases (Medline, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, CINHAL, and ScienceDirect) were searched. Two authors independently conducted all searches and reviewed all abstracts, determining article suitability. The Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was used to assess risk of bias in each study. Fourteen studies were included for analysis. Blood flow restriction aerobic exercise increased measures of aerobic fitness and performance in younger adults when using occlusion pressures ≥130 mm Hg. In older adults, measures of aerobic performance improved; however, measures of aerobic fitness remained unchanged. These findings must be interpreted with caution because methodological limitations were present in all trials. Short-term BFR aerobic exercise seems to offer a valid method of improving aerobic performance and fitness in healthy adults when using occlusion pressures >130 mm Hg. Conversely, it seems to strictly enhance aerobic performance in older adults without impacting aerobic fitness, potentially suggesting different mechanisms of adaptation between older and younger individuals. Despite methodological limitations, BFR aerobic exercise seems to have applications in scenarios where high-intensity aerobic exercise is not appropriate, although more high-quality research is needed to further demonstrate this.

Methods : Nine national-level para-alpine standing skiers (mean age, 20.67 +/- 1.34 yr; four women) were recruited. Nondominant lower limbs were trained with BFR (eight in final analyses), and dominant lower limbs were trained without BFR (seven in final analyses). The 2-wk protocol included high-load resistance, local muscle endurance (circuit resistance training), and aerobic endurance (stationary cycling) training performed 4 times a week, with BFR during local muscle endurance and aerobic endurance sessions. Muscle strength was measured by maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in the knee extensors; microcirculatory blood perfusion (MBP), by laser Doppler blood flow; and muscle strength and endurance, by the total amount of work (TW) performed during high-intensity centrifugal and concentric contractions. Results : BFR significantly increased absolute and relative MVIC (P < 0.001, P = 0.001), MBP (P = 0.011, P = 0.008), and TW (P = 0.006, P = 0.007) from pretraining values, whereas only absolute MVIC increased without BFR (P = 0.047). However, the MVIC increase with BFR exercise (35.88 +/- 14.83 N[middle dot]m) was significantly greater (P = 0.040) than without BFR exercise (16.71 +/- 17.79 N[middle dot]m). Conclusions : Short-term BFR exercise significantly increased strength endurance, muscle strength, and MBP in national-level para-alpine standing skiers. Our study provides new evidence that BFR exercise can improve local muscle blood perfusion during high-intensity exercise and informs BFR exercise strategies for athletes with disabilities.

Design: Repeated testing. Setting: Academic medical center. Participants: Seven men (age range, 39-58 y) with motor-complete paraplegia from T5 to T12 and confirmed shoulder pain occurring during daily activities. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Subjects underwent a 4-month CRT program using alternating resistance maneuvers and high-speed, low-resistance arm exercise. One-repetition maximal force was measured before training and monthly thereafter. Pretraining and posttraining peak oxygen uptake (Vo2peak) was measured by graded arm testing. Anaerobic power was measured before and after training using a 30-second Wingate Anaerobic Test. Shoulder pain was self-evaluated by an index validated for people with spinal cord injury (Wheelchair Users Shoulder Pain Index [WUSPI]). Results: Strength increases ranging from 38.6 % to 59.7 % were observed for all maneuvers (P range, .005-.008). Vo2peak increased after training by 10.4 % (P = .01), and peak and average anaerobic power increased by 6 % (P = .001) and 8.6 % (P = .005), respectively. WUSPI scores +/- standard deviation were lowered from 31.9 +/- 24.8 to 5.7 +/- 5.9 (P = .008), with 3 of 7 subjects reporting complete resolution of shoulder pain. Conclusions: CRT improves muscle strength, endurance, and anaerobic power of middle-aged men with paraplegia while significantly reducing their shoulder pain.

Twenty-eight COPD patients without comorbidities were randomly assigned to receive either EDU or CT. CT was continuously supervised to combine strength-endurance training; EDU was taught to progressively increase the rate of autonomous physical activity, through different training modalities such as Nordic walking, group classes and circuit training. Body composition, walking capacity, muscle strength, flexibility and balance, total daily energy expenditure and quality of life were evaluated at baseline, after 28 weeks training period (3d/week) and after a 14-week follow-up. No adverse events occurred during the interventions. After training, CT and EDU similarly improved walking capacity, body composition and quality of life. However, after 14 weeks of follow-up, such improvements were not maintained. Only in CT, muscle strength and flexibility improved after training but returned to baseline after follow-up. EDU, similar to CT, can effectively and safely improve health-related parameters in COPD patients. EDU could be an attractive alternative to traditional supervised training for improving quality of life in COPD patients.

Twenty-six healthy regional-level players were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (E; n = 16, age = 16.4 6 0.5) or a control group (C; n = 10, age = 16.5 6 0.5). C maintained their normal basketball training schedule, whereas for 8 weeks E replaced a part of their standard regimen by biweekly combined training sessions. Testing before and after training included the squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), drop jump (DJ), 5-, 10-, and 20-m sprints, Stork balance test (SBT), Y-balance test (YBT) and modified Illinois change of direction test (MICODT). Results indicated no significant intergroup differences in SJ and CMJ height; however, E increased their DJ height (p< 0.05, Cohens'd = 0.11). No significant intergroup differences were found for sprint performance or SBT, but dynamic YBT tended to a significant group interaction (p = 0.087, d = 0.006). Post hoc analysis also showed a significant increase of MICODT for E (D 6.68%, p = 0.041, d = 0.084). In summary, the addition of 8 weeks of balance and plyometric training to regular in-season basketball training proved a safe and feasible intervention that enhanced DJ height, balance, and agility for female adolescent basketball players relative to the standard basketball training regimen.

Maximal strength and muscle activation in the upper and lower extremities, maximal concentric power, aerobic capacity and muscle fiber size and distribution in the vastus lateralis muscle were measured before and after a 21-week training period. Ninety-six men [mean age 56 (SD 7) years] completed high-intensity strength training (S) twice a week, endurance training (E) twice a week, combined training (SE) four times per week or served as controls (C). SE and S led to similar gains in one repetition maximum strength of the lower extremities [22 (9)% and 21 (8)%, P<0.001], whereas E and C showed minor changes. Cross-sectional area of type II muscle fibers only increased in S [26 (22)%, P=0.002], while SE showed an inconsistent, non-significant change [8 (35)%, P=0.73]. Combined training may interfere with muscle hypertrophy in aging men, despite similar gains in maximal strength between the strength and the combined training groups.

The aim of this study was to compare short-term effects of a combined plyometric and speed training implemented on the same or separate days of a week on change of direction (COD), linear speed (LS), and repeated sprint ability (RSA) in young soccer players. Twenty-four male players from the same U19 soccer team were distributed into one control group (CG; n=7, soccer training only) and two experimental groups performing plyometric and speed exercises on the same (CDG; n=8) or separate days (CWG; n=9) during a 6-week preparation period. Very likely moderate within-group COD improvements were observed in the CDG (ES -0.94 [-1.47 to -0.41]) and CWG (ES -0.97 [-1.52 to -0.42]) groups. Possibly small within-group RSA improvements were also observed in the CWG (ES -0.24[-0.64 to 0.16]) and CDG (ES -0.31 [-0.79 to 0.17]) groups. CWG and CDG groups showed possibly small (ES -0.28 [-0.62 to 0.06]) and very likely moderate (ES -0.80 [-1.28 to -0.32]) within-group LS improvements following the intervention, respectively. In between group analysis, a likely moderate (ES 0.71 [0.03 to 1.39]) greater LS improvement was observed in the CDG group than in the CWG group. It is suggested to supplement normal soccer training with combined plyometric and speed exercises to improve COD, LS, and RSA performance and to implement these exercises in the same session to improve LS with a greater effect.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in body composition (BC), muscular strength, aerobic, and renal function in KT subjects submitted to combined resistance plus aerobic training. Twelve KT subjects were randomly assigned into groups: (G1) 12 weeks of combined training (3 males and 4 females, 54 ± 3 years); or (G2) nonexercise control (5 females, 43 ± 18 years). The subjects were evaluated for BC (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), estimated V̇ o 2peak, right-hand maximal grip strength (RHMGS) and left-hand maximal grip strength (LHMGS), and renal function. Post-training revealed that G1 reduced body fat percentage (p = 0.046), uric acid (Δ = −0.87; p = 0.023), urea (Δ = −9.43; p = 0.032), and creatinine (Δ = −0.15; p = 0.045), increased fat-free mass, estimated V̇ o 2peak, RHMGS, LHMGS (p < 0.05), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Δ = 11.64; p = 0.017). G2 increased urea (Δ = 8.20; p = 0.017), creatinine (Δ = 0.37; p = 0.028), and decreased eGFR (Δ = −16.10; p = 0.038).

Therefore, there is an urgent need to find out optimal exercise training programs for improving physical performance and health outcomes, especially among sedentary women. Subjects were 25- to 30-year-old women with a very low physical activity, and 65% of them were overweight (body mass index > 25). They performed endurance and strength training 3 times a week for 9 weeks. Independent strength training and instructed endurance training by indoor cycling were prescribed. Measurements were performed before, in the middle, and after the training period. No nutritional guidelines were given to the subjects. The 9-week training period led to an 8.5% increase in estimated maximal oxygen uptake. Maximal isometric strength of the leg and arm extensors as well as trunk flexors and extensors increased by 28.9, 7.8, 27.2, and 16.1%, respectively. Total cholesterol values lowered by 7.6%, and high-density lipoprotein increased by 8.8%, whereas low-density lipoprotein, hemoglobin, serum glucose, and triglyceride remained unchanged. Serum cortisol increased by 22.7%, but no changes in plasma testosterone, estradiol, or sex hormone binding globulin were observed. The skeletal muscle mass increased by 0.8% without other changes in body composition. Our results indicated that only 27 combined endurance and strength training sessions in 9 weeks improved maximal endurance and strength capacity as well as some health outcomes. Thus, combined strength and endurance training itself can induce significant health benefits without the necessity of changes in dietary habits.

This study was undertaken to examine whether muscle and performance characteristics could be improved in endurance-trained masters cyclist by adding strength and sprint-training stimuli into their training regimen. Twenty-five masters road cyclists were assigned to a combined strength and sprint-training group (CT; n = 9, 53.5 ± 9.3 years), a sprint-training group (ST, n = 7, 49.4 ± 4.8 years) or a control group (CG, n = 9, 56.9 ± 8.6 years). Before and after the 12 weeks intervention, whole body lean mass, total lower limb lean mass (LLLM), countermovement jump height, peak isometric torque of quadriceps and hamstring muscles were examined. For evaluation of sport-specific performance, 10-second sprint cycling peak power (PP10), total 30 seconds work (TW), PP output and flying 200-m time trial (TT) performance were assessed. No pretraining differences were observed between CT, ST, and CG groups for any of the dependant variables. After training, a significant (p < 0.05) between group difference was observed in TW between CT and CG groups. A significant effect of time (p < 0.05) was observed for LLLM in CT and ST groups, and for TT in the CT group. These results suggest including strength and sprint exercises in training can increase LLLM and sprint performance in endurance-trained masters road cyclists. Further research is warranted to find out an ideal pattern of training to maintain aerobic capabilities along with sprint performance in aging road cyclists.

However, structured progression of intensity in sleep parameters remains poorly investigated within this population. Purpose: To verify the effects of non-periodized and linear periodization combined training on the sleep quality of obese adults. Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial involving adults with body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2, allocated to 3 groups: control (CG; n = 13), non-periodized training (NG; n = 9), and with linear periodization (PG; n = 13). Groups PG and NG trained for 16 weeks in 3 weekly sessions lasting of 60 minutes. The NG trained in 50–59% heart rate reserve (HRR) e 2 × 10–12 repetition maximum (RM) and the PG with progression in 3 mesocycles: 40–49%;50–59%; 60–69% HRR e 2x12-14; 2x10-12; 2 × 8–10 RM, with the total volume equated. Sleep quality was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. For statistics, we used Generalized Estimation Equations considering p ≤ 0.05. Results: Sleep latency was reduced in both training groups after intervention (NG-Δ = −25.56 minutes p =.028; PG-Δ = −22.23 minutes p =.035), while significant improvements in sleep efficiency were found only in the NG (Δ = 20.67%; p =.042). Conclusion: Despite the NG's apparent superiority, which model has the best sleep effects on obese adults cannot be stated. Hence, caution is needed while extrapolating the results.

However, the effects of heavy weight training (HWT) in combination with endurance training remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of a concurrent HWT+endurance training on CR and the VO2 kinetics in endurance athletes. Fifteen triathletes were assigned to endurance+strength (ES) or endurance-only (E) training for 14 wk. The training program was similar, except ES performed two HWT sessions a week. Before and after the training period, the subjects performed 1) an incremental field running test for determination of VO2max and the velocity associated (VVO2max), the second ventilatory threshold (VT2); 2) a 3000-m run at constant velocity, calculated to require 25 % of the difference between VO2max and VT2, to determine CR and the characteristics of the VO2 kinetics; 3) maximal hopping tests to determine maximal mechanical power and lower-limb stiffness; 4) maximal concentric lower-limb strength measurements. After the training period, maximal strength were increased (P &lt; 0.01) in ES but remained unchanged in E. Hopping power decreased in E (P &lt; 0.05). After training, economy (P &lt; 0.05) and hopping power (P &lt; 0.001) were greater in ES than in E. VO2max, leg hopping stiffness and the VO2 kinetics were not significantly affected by training either in ES or E. Additional HWT led to improved maximal strength and running economy with no significant effects on the VO2 kinetics pattern in heavy exercise.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-841743&site=ehost-live"

Forty-two male students (22.02±1.91 years of age) were divided into three groups: Concurrent Distinct Endurance-Resistance (CDER), Concurrent Parallel Endurance-Resistance (CPER) and No Training controls (C). The subjects performed two training protocols per week for 12 weeks. In CDER group, resistance training and endurance training were performed on different days each week (two and two days per week). CPER group performed endurance and resistance training on the same days each week (two days per week). After a 12-week training period, fat-free mass, muscular strength [weight lifted in squat and bench press (kg)], muscular endurance [pull-ups and sit-ups (numbers)], aerobic power, flexibility and Sargent jump height increased similarly in both experimental groups (CDER and CPER). Also, decreases in body fat percentage, mean time in 60 m running and agility occurred in CDER and CPER. A significant difference in body fat percentage was seen in CPER when compared to CDER and C. Body mass increased significantly in CPER when compared to CDER and C. Although body mass increased only after the CPER protocol application, it can be concluded that both CDER and CPER protocols were similarly effective in positive transformation of body composition, aerobic power and muscular endurance.

We evaluated mid‐thigh muscle cross‐sectional area (CSA; computed tomography); vastus lateralis (VL) muscle thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length (ultrasonography); peak VO2 uptake (VO2peak) and work rate (Wpeak) (incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test); rate of force development (RFD); maximal muscle power (Pmax; force‐velocity testing); systemic oxidative stress (plasma protein carbonylation); and physical performance and quality of life. ET subjects experienced changes in mid‐thigh muscle CSA (+4%), VL muscle thickness (+11%) and pennation angle (+19%), VO2peak (+14%), Wpeak (+37%), RFD (+32% to 65%), Pmax (+38% to 51%), sit‐to‐stand time (−24%), and self‐reported health status (+20%) (all P < 0.05). No changes were noted in the CT group (P > 0.05). Protein carbonylation decreased among ET subjects (−27%; P < 0.05), but not in the CT group (P > 0.05). Changes in protein carbonylation were associated with changes in muscle size and pennation angle (r = −0.44 to −0.57), exercise capacity (r = −0.46), muscle strength (r = −0.45), and sit‐to‐stand performance (r = 0.60) (all P < 0.05). The combination of HIIT and power training improved systemic oxidative stress and limb muscle dysfunction in older people with COPD.

Effects of concurrent strength and endurance training on physical fitness and symptoms in postmenopausal women with fibromyalgia: a randomized controlled trial. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of concurrent strength and endurance training on muscle strength, aerobic and functional performance, and symptoms in postmenopausal women with fibromyalgia (FM). Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Local gym and university research laboratory. Participants: Twenty-six women with FM. Intervention: Progressive and supervised 21-week concurrent strength and endurance training. Main Outcome Measures: Muscle strength of leg extensors, upper extremities, and trunk; peak oxygen uptake (Vo 2peak), maximal workload (Wmax), and work time; 10-m walking and 10-step stair-climbing time and self-reported functional capacity (Health Assessment Questionnaire); and symptoms of FM. Results: After concurrent strength and endurance training, the groups differed significantly in Wmax (P=.001), work time (P=.001), concentric leg extension force (P=.043), walking (P=.001) and stair-climbing (P<.001) time, and fatigue (P=.038). The training led to an increase of 10% (P=.004) in Wmax and 13% (P=.004) in work time on the bicycle but no change in Vo 2peak. Conclusions: Concurrent strength and endurance training in low to moderate volume improves the muscle strength of leg extensors, Wmax, work time, and functional performance as well as perceived symptoms, fatigue in particular. Concurrent strength and endurance training is beneficial to postmenopausal women with FM without adversities, but more extensive studies are needed to confirm the results.

The review followed PRISMA recommendations using randomized controlled trials in nine databases. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, totaling a sample of 796 subjects to perform the meta-analysis. As result, concurrent training provides similar increases in 1RM as strength training for upper limbs (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.12; 95% IC: [−0.18; 0.41]; p =0.43) and for the lower limbs (SMD: −0.32; 95% IC: [−0.79; 0.15]; p =0.19). Similarly, no difference was found in the aerobic capacity between the concurrent training vs. aerobic training groups ([SMD – VO2 max]: −0.19; 95% IC: [−0.71; 0.33]; p =0.48 and [SMD – VO2 peak]: −0.24; 95% IC: [−0.57; 0.08]; p =0.14). Based on the results found, we can affirm that a) similar to strength training, concurrent training provides maximum strength development for upper and lower limbs; and b) cardiorespiratory capacity is not impaired by concurrent training in relation to aerobic training, demonstrating the compatibility of the two training sessions.

A significant but medium-sized increase from pre- to the post-training in the vertical jump (Effect size = 0.22, F = 34.44, p < 0.01) and VO2max (Effect size = 0.19, F = 32.89, p < 0.01) was observed. A significant large increase in the 1 kg (Effect size = 0.53, F = 202.17, p < 0.01) and 3 kg (Effect size = 0.48, F = 132.1, p < 0.01) ball throwing, standing long jump (Effect size = 0.53, F = 72.93, p < 0.01) and running speed (Effect size = 0.45, F = 122.21, p < 0.01) was also observed. The training group (GR and GCON) and sex factors did not significantly influence the evolution of strength variables from pre- to the post-training. The VO2max increased significantly only in GCON. Concurrent training is equally effective on training-induced explosive strength, and more efficient than resistance training only for VO2max, in prepubescent boys and girls. This should be taken into consideration in order to optimize strength training school-based programs.

The objective of this study was to verify the effects of a CT program on biochemical parameters, cardiovascular fitness, body composition and neuromuscular aspects. Twenty two elderly women physically active were randomly allocated to one of the five groups: AS (aerobic exercises followed by strength training; n=5), SA (strength activities followed by aerobics exercises; n=5), AG (aerobics exercise only; n=5), SG (strength activities only; n=4), CG (control group; n=3). The program lasted 12 weeks. Tests of dynamic and static strength, flexibility, aerobic power, body composition and biochemical parameters were conducted. In the aerobics power test, AS and SA groups showed differences in the post-test compared to the CG. In dynamic strength test of upper limbs, the groups S, SA, AS showed statistical differences from the CG in the post-test (p=0.009, 0.006 and 0.002 respectively). Only the AS group presented some difference from the pre to post-tests (P=003). AG, SG, SA, AS showed differences in the post-test in relation to the CG for the lower limbs strength test (p<0.001). From pre to post-test within the same group, the groups SG, SA and AS showed differences (p=0.001, 0.03, 0.02). Stretching, static strength, biochemical factors and body composition showed no association with any of the groups. We concluded that CT was equivalent to the strength and aerobics exercises performed exclusively.

Physical training has been studied in obese patients and is correlated with low-grade inflammation and alterations in the immune system. This study investigated the effect of concurrent training on anthropometric, inflammatory, and immunological parameters in overweight and obese adults. Fourteen sedentary volunteers (men and women) with a body mass index between 25 kg/m2 and 39.9 kg/m2 from Porto Alegre, Brazil attended a 12-week course of concurrent training. We analyzed: prior to and after training, anthropometric parameters, cytokine serum levels (interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor α, interferon γ, interleukin 17A and interleukin 10; measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), high-sensitive C reactive protein (measured by turbidimetry), and the frequency of T lymphocytes and monocytes (CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, and HLA-DR+) in peripheral blood (measured by flow cytometry). The sample consisted of ten women and four men with a mean ± SD age of 47.58 ± 3.01 years. After 12 weeks of training we observed a reduction in body weight, body mass index, waist, abdomen, and hip circumferences, the percentage mass of fat, and an increase in the time taken to reach exhaustion (p < 0.05). The participants had increased frequencies of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes and a reduction in the frequencies of HLA-DR+ monocytes (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the levels of tumor necrosis factor a and high-sensitive C reactive protein increased (p < 0.05). Our data suggest that concurrent training can improve body composition as well as increasing T cell proliferation in overweight and obese patients. However, the progression of the exercises can be physiologically stressful to these patients, as demonstrated by the inflammatory markers.

Participants were selected on a random basis for resistance training (n = 12), concurrent training (n = 11) and a control group (n = 13). They performed three weekly sessions for 16 weeks (resistance training: 10 exercises with 3 × 8–10 repetition maximum; concurrent training: 6 exercises with 3 × 8–10 repetition maximum, followed by 30 minutes of walking or running at 55–85% [Vdot]O2peak). Maximal strength was tested in bench press and leg press. The peak oxygen uptake ([Vdot]O2peak) was measured by an incremental exercise test. Tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were determined. The upper- and lower-body maximal strength increase for both resistance (+42.52%; +20.9%, respectively) and concurrent training (+28.35%; +21.5%, respectively) groups (P = 0.0001).[Vdot]O2peak increased in concurrent training when comparing pre- and post-training (P = 0.0001; +15.6%). No differences were found in tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 for both groups after the exercise. C-reactive protein increased in resistance training (P = 0.004). These findings demonstrated that 16 weeks of moderate- to high-intensity training could improve functional capacity, but did not decrease inflammatory biomarkers in middle-aged men.

However, there is a lack of studies investigating the effects of concurrent training in hypertensive women. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of concurrent training program on rest blood pressure, biochemical variables (blood glucose and total cholesterol), anthropometric (body mass index and waist circumference) and functional fitness in hypertensive women. Eighteen hypertensive postmenopausal and untrained women (59±12 years old) started in the intervention, but only ten subjects finished. The voluntaries were enrolled in concurrent training, 60 min/day, 3 times a week, during 6 months. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol, body mass index, waist circumference and functional fitness (AAPHERD) were measured pre and post experimental period. Data were analyzed using the Student's t test with significance level set at 5% (P≤0.05) and Cohen's Effect Size (ES). The results showed significant improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest. The other variables did not show significantly changes, but the ES was medium and large for several variables (body mass index, blood glucose, total cholesterol, agility, coordination, aerobic fitness, strength endurance and general functional fitness index). In conclusion, this study confirms that 6 month of concurrent training program improved systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive women. In addition, the protocol suggests an improvement in anthropometric, biochemical and functional variables related to health.

However, because of fiber type-specific recruitment, such attenuation may only account for high-oxidative muscle fibers. Here, we investigate the effects of concurrent training on oxidative capacity (as measured by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity) by using task-specific recruitment of the high- and low-oxidative compartment of rat medial gastrocnemius muscle (GM). Methods: Forty rats were subjected to 6 wk of peak power training (PT, n = 10), endurance training (ET, n = 10), concurrent peak power and endurance training (PET, n = 10), or no training (control, n = 10). SDH activity, mRNA expression of SDH, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), receptor-interacting protein 140, and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 3 as well as PGC-1α protein levels were analyzed in the low- and high-oxidative region of the GM. Results: In the low-oxidative compartment, PT and PET induced a 30% decrease in SDH activity of Type IIB fibers compared with controls and ET (P < 0.001) without changes in mRNA or protein levels. In the high-oxidative compartment, after ET, SDH mRNA levels were 42% higher and RIP140 mRNA levels 33% lower compared with controls, which did not result in changes in SDH activity. Conclusion: These results indicate that in compartmentalized rat GM, peak power on top of endurance training attenuated transcription of mRNA for mitochondrial proteins in high-oxidative muscle fibers. In low-oxidative Type IIB fibers, peak power training substantially decreased SDH activity, which was not related to lower SDH mRNA levels. It is concluded that PT and PET enhanced mitochondrial degradation in the low-oxidative compartment of rat GM.

Technique of playing activities of an individual, decision-making process of players and especially speed of the game are influenced by already mentioned abilities. The aim of our study was to recognize the level of motor performance in regional centres of handball and at the same time to verify the efficiency of sports preparation. This programme includes the change of weekly microcycle practice, consisting of 2 conditioning trainings focused on strength and endurance. The research was realized in these age categories: younger (n=40) and older juniors (n=38). To evaluate the level of motor abilities we selected 5 simply performed activities: bench press (explosive strength of upper extremities), run for 8x5 metres (speed with change of direction), sit-ups for 2 minutes (power of abdominal muscles), standing long jump with legs together (explosive strength of lower extremities) and 12 minutes run (aerobic endurance). When following microcycle programme weekly, the results of motor test pointed out the positive influence of this programme on the development of strength and aerobic endurance (p≤0.05). In category of older juniors the performance in test of 12 minutes run has fallen significantly in comparison with the first testing (p≤0.05). The result of this study indicates the lack of recommended aerobic running practice in weekly microcycles of monitored teams.

Subjects were members of the Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association. They were divided into two groups (of whom 9 belonged to the training group, and 8 belonged to the control group). Changes in flexibility (forward flexion and back flexion), maximal muscular strength (back extension and squat), isometric strength (back strength), and core muscle and driver shot performance (ball speed, clubhead speed, and carry distance) were measured before and after 12 weeks' combined training. The results were as follows: in physical fitness parameters, back flexion and maximal strength of back extension and squat increased significantly in training group following 12 weeks' core muscle strengthening training. In driver shot performance, clubhead speed and carry distance increased significantly in training group following 12 weeks' core training. The findings of the present study showed 12 weeks' combined core muscle training had positive effects on flexibility and strength of core muscle. Moreover, it was effective in enhancing driver shot performance in female professional golfers. This suggests that application of specific and scientific core muscle training should be done continuously in female professional golfers.

Sedentary adult males characterized as hyperinsulinemic (fasting insulin greater than 2 OuU.mL-1), randomly assigned to two groups (N = 8 each), completed 14 wk of training at 3 d.wk-1. An endurance-only (E) group performed both continuous cycle exercise and walking (30 min each at 60-70 percent heart rate reserve). A cross-training (C) group performed both endurance and resistance exercise (8 exercises, 4 sets/exercise, 8-12 repetitions/set) in a single session. Both E and C groups demonstrated similar increases in VO2max (25 percent and 27 percent) while only C demonstrated an increase in 1 RM bench press (19 percent) and leg press (25 percent). The changes induced by C training were significantly greater than those from E training alone in percent fat (6.9 plus/minus 1.3 vs 1.4 plus/minus 1.4), insulin concentration (8.5 plus/minus 2.7 vs 3.0 plus/minus 1.3 uU.mL-1), glucose levels (11.1 plus/minus 2.9 vs 5.9 plus/minus 2.6 mg.dL-1), HDL-C levels (5.1 plus/minus 1.3 vs 2.9 plus/minus 1.6 mg.dL-1), triglyceride concentration (43.8 plus/minus 13.6 mg.dL-1), and systolic blood pressure (14.6 plus/minus 5.5 vs 8.3 plus/minus 6.8 mm Hg).

Eleven women survivors of stage I - II ductal breast carcinoma (47 +/- 7 yrs) entered the study and performed a battery of tests (including anthropometric evaluation, a graded cycle ergometer test, tests of strength endurance [leg and bench press] and the sit-stand test) and completed a specific QOL questionnaire (EORTC-C30) at three time points: i) before, ii) after an exercise program (including aerobic and resistance exercises) of 8-weeks duration, and iii) after a subsequent 8-weeks period of training cessation. Training-induced improvements in strength endurance, muscle functional capacity (sit-stand test) and QOL were not significantly changed after detraining (p &gt; 0.05 for post-training vs. detraining comparisons). The lack of significant loss in muscle strength endurance occurred despite significant losses in estimated total muscle mass after detraining (27.3 +/- 2.4 kg) compared with post-training (28.5 +/- 2.9 kg). In contrast, cardiorespiratory capacity was significantly decreased during detraining (VO2peak of 29.0 +/- 4.6 vs. 22.7 +/- 3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1 at post-training vs. detraining, p &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, cancer survivors who have participated in a combined training program can retain some of the training gains (particularly improved QOL and muscle strength endurance/functional performance) after a relatively short duration detraining period.

A total of 89 middle‐aged adults (53.5 ± 4.9 years old; ~53% women) participated in the FIT‐AGEING study. A 12‐week randomized controlled trial was performed with a parallel group design. The participants were randomly assigned to (a) a concurrent training based on physical activity recommendation from the World Health Organization group (PAR group), (b) a high‐intensity interval training group (HIIT group), and (c) a high‐intensity interval training group adding whole‐body electromyostimulation group (WB‐EMS group). A significant decrease of fat body mass, fat body mass index, and visceral adipose tissue was observed in all training modalities compared to the control group (all P ≤ 0.001). There was a significant increase in lean body mass in the HIIT group as well as in the WB‐EMS group compared to the control group and the PAR group (all P ≤ 0.044), whereas an increment of lean body mass index was only observed in the WB‐EMS group compared to the control group and the PAR group (all P ≤ 0.042). A significant increase of bone mineral content was observed in the WB‐EMS group compared to the control group (P = 0.015), while no changes were found in the PAR group and in the HIIT group compared to the control group (all P ≥ 0.2). Our findings suggest that PAR, HIIT, and WB‐EMS can be used as a strategy to improve body composition parameters, obtaining slightly better results with the application of WB‐EMS.

METHODS: The PubMed electronic database was searched for eligible studies meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomized control trial design; (2) participants aged 18-64 years with a body mass index ≥ 25 kg⋅m-1; (2) investigated the efficacy of some type of exercise on at least one body composition indicator such as body mass, body fat, and fat-free mass); (3) published in English from inception up to 30 September 2020. Data extraction for comparisons was completed for six intervention categories: (1) control (CON); (2) continuous endurance training (CET); (3) interval training (INT); (4) resistance training (RT); (5) combined training (CT); and (6) hybrid-type training (HYB). A random-effects NMA was performed within a frequentist framework. Of the 1179 articles retrieved, 68 studies with a total 3509 participants were included in the NMA. The intervention ranking was completed through a Bayesian model where mean and standard deviation were equal to the respective frequentist estimates. RESULTS: Based on mean difference (MD) comparisons, CT (MD = -2.57, 95% CI [-3.78, -1.36]), INT (MD = -2.27, 95% CI [-3.46, -1.08]), and HYB (MD = -2.23, 95% CI [-4.34, -0.11]) demonstrated statistically significant improvements in body mass compared with CON. CT (MD = -2.76, 95% CI [-5.42, -0.09]), HYB (MD = -2.63, 95% CI [-5.12, -0.14]), and INT (MD = -2.16, 95% CI [-3.69, -0.62]) reveal significant reductions in body fat when compared with CON. No statistically significant differences were observed between any exercise type and CON. Overall, CT had the higher probability of being ranked best in improving body mass (37.4%), body fat (40.8%), and fat-free mass (55.4%) compared with other exercise types in the network comparison. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider this evidence when prescribing exercise for overweight and obese adults to ensure optimal effectiveness.

Participants of the experimental groups were male sport students experienced in weight training (age: 23.98 +/- 3.14 yr). Subjects were tested for the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) in the bench press, maximal movement velocity (Vmax) in the bench press throw (16.9 kg), maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), and maximal rate of force development (MRFD) in 90 degrees elbow and shoulder angle in the isometric bench press. According to their 1RM, subjects were parallelized and assigned to 1 of either 2 training groups: strength-power periodization (SPP, n = 13) or daily undulating periodization (DUP, n = 14). Subjects trained for 14 weeks, 3 days per week. In the strength-power sessions, both groups were instructed to lift the weight as explosively as possible. In addition, a control group (n = 13) was used for comparison. One repetition maximum and Vmax improved significantly through training (p <or= 0.05), with no significant changes in MVC and MRFD. Experimental groups showed no significant group differences in any variable. The results indicate that, in short-term training using previously trained subjects, no differences in 1RM and power are seen between DUP and SPP. As used in our undulating regime, additional training in strength endurance could lead to exhaustion effects and furthermore does not provide an adequate training stimulus for power because of its low training intensity. In spite of this, according to the present findings, it has no negative effect on the application of a neural stimulus that is needed for a strength-power session if adequate regeneration time between workouts is guaranteed.

Effects of different periodization strategies of combined aerobic and strength training on heart rate variability in older women. J Strength Cond Res 35(7): 2033–2039, 2021—The preservation of autonomic function has been proposed to be a key determinant of health and longevity. Periodization in combined training (CT) (strength plus aerobic exercise in the same session) might improve autonomic modulation. However, the specific influences of nonperiodized (NP), flexible nonlinear periodized (FNLP), and nonlinear periodized (NLP) strategies of CT on heart rate variability (HRV) are currently unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of NP, FNLP, and NLP strategies of CT on HRV in physically active women. In total, 54 physically active older women (61.6 6 6.3 years) previously engaged in a regular exercise training were randomly allocated into 3 groups: NP, FNLP, and NLP. All the subjects performed 12 weeks of training, 3 times per week, with the sessions divided into aerobic (bicycle or treadmill) and strength exercises. Before and after the exercise training, we examined anthropometric, body composition, and HRV measures (low-frequency [LF], high-frequency [HF], LF/ HF, and root mean square successive difference of RR intervals [RMSSD]) during rest, a maximum exercise test, and recovery post-test. Mixed-model measures were used, and statistical significance was set at a = 0.05. The waist circumference reduced only in the NP group (Δ = 22.01%). The RMSSD increased in the NLP (Δ = 76.5%) and LF/HF ratio increased in the FNLP (Δ = 34.51%) during the rest period. There were no differences during the exercise test and recovery after test for LF, HF, LF/HF, or RMSSD. In active women, nonlinear periodization strategies of CT improved one of the cardiovascular health outcomes because HRV is a direct predictor of cardiovascular risk.

In young people, maximum muscle strength is generally higher than it is necessary for daily needs, while it is constantly decreasing during the aging process. Muscle force and muscle strength loss happen due to aging and reduced physical activity, which causes a decrease in muscle function. It used to be thought that the ability of physiological adaptation to training significantly decreases during the aging process. However, the researches among elderly have proved that people in this age have the ability to increase their muscle strength, force and endurance by intensive training. The paper analyses the researches published after 2000, which studied the effects of different programs of physical exercise on muscle strength among people between 40 and 80 years of age. Taking into account the applied programs of exercise and health status of the examinees, the collected research results have been classified into three groups: the effects of resistance trainings on muscle strength, the effects of other exercise programs on muscle strength and the effects of different exercise programs on muscle strength in patients with impaired health status. According to the results of the analyzed researches, the most significant influence on preservation and development of muscle strength among middle aged and elderly is attributed to the resistance training programs, and combined training programs that include a combination of aerobic training and resistance training.

Circuit weight and aerobic training was used to assess the effects of drugs on cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength. Fifty-two sedentary men, ages 25-59 yr, with a diastolic blood pressure of 90-105 mm Hg off drugs, without significant ST depression during maximal stress testing, received diltiazem, propranolol, or placebo. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and exercise duration during treadmill testing, as well as one-repetition maximal strength, were assessed on eight weight machines after a single-blind placebo baseline, after 2 wk of drug run-in, and after 10 wk of exercise training. Total daily doses were 240 mg for propranolol and 360 mg for diltiazem. Propranolol decreased VO2max after drug run-in. Exercise training increased VO2max in the diltiazem and placebo groups. After training, VO2max in the propranolol group increased from run-in but not beyond baseline levels. Thus, the reduction of VO2max consequent to propranolol therapy limited the overall benefits of training. Exercise duration did not change with run-in and increased with training by 22%, 19%, and 10% for the diltiazem, placebo, and propranolol groups, respectively. Strength after run-in was unchanged, and exercise training increased strength on all weight machines in all groups. The results show an advantage of diltiazem to propranolol, particularly among physically active patients engaged in aerobic exercise who require antihypertensive therapy.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH254585&site=ehost-live"

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of short-term downhill walking and level walking training on lower limb strength and maximal oxygen uptake of active individuals. Eighteen young adults were divided into level walking group (n = 9) or downhill walking training group (n = 9). Both groups performed a four-week training program. The level walking group performed seven level walking sessions per week, while the downhill walking group walked downhill (-16%) in the same weekly frequency. One week before and one week after the training protocol, maximal oxygen uptake, muscle-bone cross-sectional area and isometric peak torque of knee extensors and plantar flexors were assessed for both groups. A significant group vs. time interaction was found only for cross sectional area of plantar flexors (PF), showing increases for the downhill walking group (112.6 ± 28.9 cm² vs. 115.9 ± 29 cm²) but not for the level walking group (94.9 ± 23.3 cm²vs. 94.6 ± 228 cm²). Maximal oxygen uptake remained unaltered after training for both groups and IPT was increased after training for both groups. It was concluded that short-term downhill walking training does not seem to be efficient in promoting improvements in cardiorrespiratory fitness of young adults. However, it seems to promote gains in some variables related to neuromuscular fitness. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=110454469&site=ehost-live"

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of eight weeks of resistance training by traditional and TRX methods on physical fitness factors and extremities perimeter of non-athlete underweight girls. Material and methods: Thirty non-athlete underweight female students qualified with an average age of 23±1.64 years, weight of 43.53±0.28 kg, height of 162.66±6.6 cm and BMI of 16.31±0.2 kg/m² were selected and randomly assigned into three groups of 10 subjects (traditional, TRX and control). Participants performed training of 3 sessions per week for eight weeks. Before and after the period of training, physical fitness variables including muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, thigh and arm circumferences were measured. Results: The results showed that both forms of training had a significant effect on muscular strength and endurance. There was no significant difference in flexibility and thigh and arm circumferences. Conclusion: It can be concluded, that the traditional and TRX training have created almost same improvements in physical fitness factors, so TRX training can be considered an efficient choice to do alongside traditional training or as its alternative in order to earn desired training achievements. It is noteworthy that when training goal is to enhance muscular strength and endurance especially in upper-body, TRX training appears to be accompanied by greater gains compared to traditional resistance training.

To verify the effects of resistance training at the electromyographic fatigue threshold (EMG17) based on one-repetition maximum strength (1RM), heart rate (HR), rate of perceived exertion (PE) and endurance time (EndT). Methods. Nineteen subjects (training group [TG]: n = 10; control group [CG]: n = 9), performed 1-mm bicep curl exercises sets at 25%, 30%, 35% and 40% 1RM. Electromyography (biceps brachii and brachiorradialis), HR and PE were registered. Biceps brachii EMGFT was used to create a load index for an eight-week resistance training programme (three sets until exhaustion/session, two sessions/week) for the TG. The CG only attended one session in the first week and another session in the last week of the eight-week training period for EndT measurement. EndT was determined from the number of repetitions of each of the three sets performed in the first and last training sessions. After training, 1RM, EMGFT, EndT, HR and PE at the different bicep curl load intensities were again measured for both groups. Results. Increases in 1RM (5.9%, p < 0.05) and EndT (> 60%, p < 0.001) after training were found. In addition, PE was reduced at all load intensities (p < 0.05), while no changes were found for HR and EMGFT after training. Conclusions. Strength-endurance training based on the EMGFT improved muscular endurance and also, to a lesser extent, muscular strength. Moreover, the reduced levels of physical exertion after training at the same intensity suggest that endurance training exercises may improve comfort while performing strength exercises.

Squat jump (SJ), counter movement jump (CMJ) and drop jump (DJ) were performed to assess the effects of the training protocols 98 athletes (100 & 200m and 100m & 110m hurdles) voluntarily took part in this study, 51 males (52%) and 47 females (48%), 17.91 ± 1.42 years old, and 5.16 ± 2.56 years of training experience. The participants were randomly assigned to four different groups according to the frequency and the timing of the stimulation. Analysis of covariance was used to analyze the effects of every training program on jump height. Our findings suggest that compared to control (Plyometrics (PT) only), the combination of 150Hz EMS + PT simultaneously combined in an 8 week (2days/week) training program, we could observe significant jump height improvements in the different types of strength: explosive, explosiveelastic, and explosive-elastic-reactive. The combination of PT after ⩽ 85 Hz EMS did not show any jump height significant increase in sprinters. In conclusion, an eight week training program (with just two days per week) of EMS combined with plyometric exercises has proven useful for the improvement of every kind of vertical jump ability required for sprint and hurdles disciplines in teenage athletes.

All rats continued feeding for another 8 weeks. Plasma insulin, glucose load, and plasma membrane insulin receptor binding radiommunoassay and radioligand receptor assay in the rats were determined. Results showed that hyperinsulinemia, low insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance appeared, the area below plasma insulin secretary curve and insulin peak value of glucose load were increased, and the insulin receptor binding decreased in DIO rats. Endurance training could abate insulin resistance, enhance insulin sensitivity and lower the level of hyperinsulinemia through increasing insulin receptor binding in hepatocytes, adipocytes and white myocytes membranes. It was demonstrated that hyperinsulinemia, low insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance were the characteristics of DIO rats, and endurance training was the effective measure for reducing body fat by modifying metabolic disorder in DIO rats.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-19019&site=ehost-live"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of exercise therapy on skeletal muscle strength, mass, and exercise capacity in patients with connective tissue disease treated with high doses of glucocorticoids. Methods: This prospective, observational, single-center, cohort study included 35 patients aged ≥ 15 years diagnosed with connective tissue disease who received high-dose glucocorticoids and physical training. Exercise therapy, including moderate aerobic and strength training, was performed five times a week. Knee extension strength, skeletal muscle mass, anaerobic threshold, and peak oxygen consumption were measured at the beginning of exercise therapy and at discharge. Results: After 6 weeks of aerobic and strength exercises, skeletal muscle mass significantly decreased by 5.5%, right knee extension decreased by 11.6%, and left knee extension decreased by 9.7%. The anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen consumption significantly increased by 13.0% and 9.0%, respectively. The increase in glucocorticoid dose was inversely correlated with changes in knee extension strength. Conclusion: In patients with connective tissue disease being treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, exercise therapy might attenuate the decrease in skeletal muscle mass and strength and increase the anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen consumption, thus moderating the side effects of high-dose glucocorticoid treatment.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative effects of different types of exercise interventions on aerobic capacity measured by peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this population. Methods For this systematic review and indirect-comparisons meta-analysis (network meta-analysis), different electronic databases were searched up to February 2020 for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of different types of exercise interventions on peak VO2 and HRQoL of people living with HIV/AIDS. Mean differences, standardized mean difference (SMD), and 95% CI were calculated. Fixed- and random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis were used to compare the relative effectiveness of the different exercise interventions. Results Forty studies met the study criteria, reporting on a total of 1518 patients. When comparing the exercise interventions with usual care (control group) for the peak VO2 outcome, combined aerobic and resistance exercise was the highest ranked exercise intervention with an SMD of 4.2 (95% CI = 2.5 to 5.9), followed by aerobic exercise (SMD = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.4 to 5.1). Compared with aerobic exercise, resistance training, and yoga, combined aerobic and resistance exercise was the best exercise intervention to promote improvement on physical function, general health, mental health, and energy/vitality domains HRQoL. Conclusion The combined aerobic and resistance exercise was the highest ranked exercise intervention to improve peak VO2 and HRQoL. Combined aerobic and resistance exercise should be considered as a component of care for people living with HIV/AIDS.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been popularized for its efficacy in improving both aerobic fitness and strength but never assessed within the aforementioned population group. This study looked to compare the effect of exercise modality, e. g., a traditional aerobic mode (AM) and strength mode (SM), during HIIT on aerobic fitness and strength. Sixteen well resistance-trained male participants, currently competing in powerlifting and strongman events, completed 8 weeks of approximately effort- and volume-matched HIIT in 2 groups: AM (cycling, n = 8) and SM (resistance training, n = 8). Aerobic fitness was measured as predicted ...O2max using the YMCA 3 minutes step test and strength as predicted 1 repetition maximum from a 4-6RM test using a leg extension. Both groups showed significant improvements in both strength and aerobic fitness. There was a significant between-group difference for aerobic fitness improvements favoring the AM group (p ≤ 0.05). There was no between-group difference for change in strength. Magnitude of change using within-group effect size for aerobic fitness and strength was considered large for each group (aerobic fitness, AM = 2.6, SM = 2.0; strength, AM = 1.9, SM = 1.9). In conclusion, our results support enhanced strength and aerobic fitness irrespective of exercise modality (e.g., traditional aerobic and resistance training). However, powerlifters and strongman athletes wishing to enhance their aerobic fitness should consider HIIT using an aerobic HIIT mode.

Methods: Ten healthy men age 39 ± 10 yr with chronic paraplegia (13.2 ± 8.8 yr, ASIA A--C) completed three isocaloric bouts of upper-body exercise and a resting control. After an overnight fast, participants completed circuit resistance exercise (CRE) first and the following conditions in a randomized order, separated by >48 h: i) control (CON), ~45-min seated rest; ii) moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), ~40-min arm cranking at a resistance equivalent to ~30% peak power output (PPO); and iii) high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), ~30 min arm cranking with resistance alternating every 2 min between 10% PPO and 70% PPO. After each condition, participants completed a mixed-meal tolerance test consisting of a 2510-kJ liquid meal (35% fat, 50% carbohydrate, 15% protein). Blood and expired gas samples were collected at baseline and regular intervals for 150 min after a meal. Results: An interaction (P < 0.001) was observed, with rates of lipid oxidation elevated above CON in HIIE until 60 min after a meal and in CRE at all postprandial time points up to 150 min after a meal. Postprandial blood glycerol was greater in MICE (P = 0.020) and CRE (P = 0.001) compared with CON. Furthermore, nonesterified fatty acid area under the curve had a moderate-to-strong effect in CRE versus MICE and HIIE (Cohen's d = -0.76 and -0.50, respectively). Conclusions: In persons with paraplegia, high-intensity exercise increased postprandial energy expenditure independent of the energy cost of exercise. Furthermore, exercise combining resistance and endurance modes (CRE) showed the greater effect on postprandial lipid oxidation.

Methods: Following the checklist of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols, the PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus databases were searched using specific keywords up to January 2018. The methodological quality of the studies found was rated by the means of specific scales according to their specific design. Results: A total of 44 studies were selected. The majority of the included studies were randomized controlled trials (n = 17), followed by non-controlled studies (n = 11), non-randomized controlled trials (n = 10), and comparative studies (n = 6). Aerobic, strengthening, and combined exercise programs were the most frequently proposed interventions. Exercise showed to have significant effects on the cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness. Not all the selected studies reported improvements in parameters related to body composition. Conclusions: There is sufficient scientific evidence for the beneficial effects of exercise on the cardiovascular and muscular fitness of adults with mild/moderate ID. There is a need for more studies focused on the impact of physical exercise on the body composition of this population, and those that aim at identifying the impact of alternative interventions. There is a need for basic guidelines that can help rehabilitation professionals to prescribe exercise for maintaining and improving physical fitness in the adults with intellectual disabilities. In adults with intellectual disabilities, aerobic exercise has beneficial effects on cardiovascular and muscular fitness, flexibility, and range of motion. No firm conclusion can be made regarding the effects of aerobic, muscular, and combined training programs on the body composition of adults with intellectual disabilities. Rehabilitation professionals should be aware that scientific evidence regarding the prescription of alternative exercise protocols in adults with intellectual disabilities (i.e. dancing, water-based exercise, animal therapy, etc) is scarce.

Methods: A randomized crossover research design was used. Sixteen trained men performed 4 training interventions consisting of endurance training (ET) followed by resistance training (RT), with 20% and 40% VL, respectively (ET + RT20 and ET + RT40), and RT with 20% and 40% VL, respectively, followed by ET (RT20 + ET and RT40 + ET). The ET consisted of running for 10 minutes at 90% of maximal aerobic velocity. The RT consisted of 3 squat sets with 60% of 1-repetition maximum. A 5-minute rest was given between exercises. The oxygen uptake throughout the ET and repetition velocity during RT were recorded. The blood lactate concentration, vertical jump, and squat velocity were measured at preexercise and after the endurance and strength exercises. Results: The RT40 + ET protocol showed an impaired running time along with higher ventilatory equivalents compared with those protocols that performed the ET without previous fatigue. No significant differences were observed in the repetitions per set performed for a given VL threshold, regardless of the exercise sequence. The protocols consisting of 40%VL induced greater reductions in jump height and squat velocity, along with elevated blood lactate concentration. Conclusions: A high VL magnitude (40%VL) induced higher metabolic and mechanical stress, as well as greater residual fatigue, on the following ET performance.

However, a comparative of the effects of dual-task and exercisecognitive activity combined training on gait speed and the blood flow of dorsolateral prefontal cortex in healthy older adults have not been performed. Methods: Fortyfive volunteers were recruited (8 male; 39 female; age range 65-83 years). Subjects were divided into i) control (balance and gait), ii) dual-task training (cognitive activity simultaneous with balance and gait), iii) exercise-cognitive activity combined training (balance and gait activity asynchronously at different times during the same day) groups. Gait speed under single-task and dual-task conditions was obtained at baseline and at the end of training period. Prefrontal cortex activity during Stroop task was assessed by use of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) modality before and after the 4 week interventions. Results: Participants performing cognitive activity showed a significant increase in single and dual task gait speed at post-intervention when compared to pre-intervention measurements (p<0.05). Subjects performing balance and gait activity asynchronously at different times during the same day had significantly reduced local brain oxygenation at post-intervention when compared to pre-intervention (p<0.05). Conclusions: Daily activities which require dual task such as walking while talking or crossing streets may be improved to a greater extent with an exercise-cognitive activity combined training protocol involving balance, gait and cognitive activities at different times when compared to the dual task training.

The experimental group trained 6-9 times per week with a programme consisting of 34 percent explosive type strength training and 66 percent endurance training during the first 3 weeks of the experiment and 42 percent and 58 percent respectively during the last 3 weeks of the experiment. The total volume of training of the control group (eight skiers) was of the same magnitude but consisted of 85 percent pure endurance training and 15 percent endurance type strength training. The experimental training regime resulted in specific changes in neuromuscular performance. This was demonstrated by improvements (P is less than 0.01) in the maximal heights of rise of the centre of gravity in the squat and countermovement jumps. A significant decrease took place also in the time of rapid isometric force production during experimental training, while no changes occurred in the maximal force of the trained muscles. Aerobic performance characteristics of the experimental group did not change during the experimental training period. No significant changes occurred in neuromuscular or aerobic performance characteristics in the control group. These findings indicated that training-induced improvements in explosive force production may not be fully inhibited by this kind of aerobic training. They also suggested that endurance athletes could undertake explosive type strength training programmes without a concomitant reduction in aerobic capacity, if the overall loading of training were within predefined limits.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH274862&site=ehost-live"

This study investigated the effect of a high intensity resistance training (HIRT) and a low intensity endurance rowing (LIER) on MHC isoform expression in highly trained human muscle. Six well-trained male rowers underwent a training program consisting of a 3-week HIRT and a 3-week LIER, each followed by one-week of recovery. Muscle samples were taken from vastus lateralis before and at the end of each training and recovery phase. MHC isoform was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using silver stain and MHC isoform mRNA by RT-PCR. The maximum oxygen uptake and power output did not change after the training. MHC isoform composition did not change over HIRT or LIER, and there was a decrease in MHC I with concomitant increase in MHC IIa after recovery following HIRT. HIRT led to mRNA upregulation of MHC I alpha, I beta and IIx (127 %, 148 % and 117 %, respectively, p &lt; 0.05), but not MHC I protein (60 % vs 62 %, NS), and LIER led merely to MHC I beta mRNA upregulation (131 %, p &lt; 0.05). Thus, different responses of MHC isoform expression to HIRT and LIER occurred in the highly trained muscle, and a ""ceiling effect"" in terms of MHC I expression could be observed. The upregulation of MHC I alpha mRNA in human skeletal muscle documented in this study may encourage further observations in this field.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-892437&site=ehost-live"

Twenty-two young men were assigned into either resistance training ( RE; N = 11) or resistance training plus high-intensity interval cycling ( REC; N = 11). Lower body muscle strength and rate of force development ( RFD), quadriceps cross-sectional area ( CSA) and vastus lateralis muscle architecture, muscle fiber type composition and capillarization, and estimated aerobic capacity were evaluated before and after 8 weeks of training (2 times per week). Muscle strength and quadriceps CSA were significantly and similarly increased after both interventions. Fiber CSA increased significantly and similarly after both RE (type I: 13.6 ± 3.7%, type IIA: 17.6 ± 4.4%, type IIX: 23.2 ± 5.7%, P < 0.05) and REC (type I: 10.0 ± 2.7%, type IIA: 14.8 ± 4.3% type IIX: 20.8 ± 6.0%, P < 0.05). In contrast, RFD decreased and fascicle angle increased ( P < 0.05) only after REC. Capillary density and estimated aerobic capacity increased ( P < 0.05) only after REC. These results suggest that high-intensity interval cycling performed after heavy-resistance exercise may not inhibit resistance exercise-induced muscle strength/hypertrophy after 2 months of training, while it prompts aerobic capacity and muscle capillarization. The addition of high-intensity cycling after heavy-resistance exercise may decrease RFD partly due to muscle architectural changes.

All subjects performed an incremental test to exhaustion ( VOmax) on a cycle ergometer before and after training. Standard pulmonary function tests, maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax), maximum expiratory pressure (PEmax), and maximal flow volume loops were performed pre training and after each week of training. HIT subjects performed a 4-week training program, 3 days a week, on a cycle ergometer at 90% of their VOmax final workload, while the ET subjects performed exercise at 60-70% VOmax. The HIT group performed five 1-min bouts with 3-min recovery periods and the ET group cycled for 45 min continuously. A five-mile time trial (TT) was performed prior to, after 2 weeks, and after completion of training. Both groups showed improvements ( P < 0.05) in VOmax (~8-10%) and TT (HIT 6.5 ± 1.3%, ET 4.4 ± 1.8%) following training with no difference ( P > 0.05) between groups. Both groups increased ( P < 0.05) PImax post training (ET ~ 25%, HIT ~ 43%) with values significantly higher for HIT than ET. There was no change ( P > 0.05) in expiratory flow rates with training in either group. These data suggest that both whole-body exercise training and HIT are effective in increasing inspiratory muscle strength with HIT offering a time-efficient alternative to ET in improving aerobic capacity and performance.

No significant changes occurred in the NT or T group's predicted VO2 max (ml/kg/min) when measured on the cycle ergometer. Predicted aerobic capacity on the treadmill increased 17% for the NT group, but T group's VO2 max remained unchanged. VO2 max when measured on the treadmill improved 14 and 16% for the T and NT groups, respectively. An increased volume of heavy leg-resistance training induced mean percent increases in the NT groups maximal VO2 when measured on the treadmill and cycle ergometer.

Eighteen endurance athletes were divided into two training groups: normoxic (Nor, n = 8) and hypoxic (H, n = 10). Three weeks (W1–W3) of endurance training (5 sessions of 1 h to 1 h and 30 min per week) were completed. All training sessions were performed under normoxic [160 Torr inspired Po2 (PɪO2)] or hypoxic conditions (≈100 Torr PɪO2, ≈3,000 m) for Nor and H group, respectively, at the same relative intensity. Before and after the training period, an incremental test to exhaustion in normoxia was performed, muscle biopsy samples were taken from the vastus lateralis, and mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized fibers was measured. Peak power output (PPO) increased by 7.2% and 6.6% (P < 0.05) for Nor and H, respectively, whereas maximal O2 uptake (V̇o2 max) remained unchanged: 58.1 ± 0.8 vs. 61.0 ± 1.2 ml·kg-1·min-1 and 58.5 ± 0.7 vs. 58.3 ± 0.6 ml·kg-1·min-1 for Nor and H, respectively, between pretraining (W0) and posttraining (W4). Maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration significantly increased for glutamate + malate (6.27 ± 0.37 vs. 8.51 ± 0.33 μmol O2·min-1·g dry weight-1) and significantly decreased for palmitate + malate (3.88 ± 0.23 vs. 2.77 ± 0.08 μmol O2·min-1·g dry weight-1) in the H group. In contrast, no significant differences were found for the Nor group. The findings demonstrate that 1) a 3-wk training period increased the PPO at sea level without any changes in V̇o2 max and 2) a 3-wk hypoxic exercise training seems to alter the intrinsic properties of mitochondrial function, i.e., substrate preference.

Fourteen moderately trained male endurance runners were allocated into either the intermittent sprint training group (n = 7) or the plyometric training group (n = 7). The preliminary tests required subjects to perform a treadmill graded exercise test, a countermovement jump test for peak power measurement, and a 10-km time trial. Training included 12 sessions of either intermittent sprint or plyometric training carried out twice per week. On completion of the intervention, post-tests were conducted. Both groups showed significant reduction in weekly training mileage from pre-intervention during the intervention period. There were significant improvements in the 10-km time trial performance and peak power. There was also significant improvement in relative peak power for both groups. The 10-km time trial performance and relative peak power showed a moderate inverse correlation. These findings showed that both intermittent sprint and plyometric training resulted in improved 10-km running performance despite reduction in training mileage. The improvement in running performance was accompanied by an improvement in peak power and showed an inverse relationship with relative peak power.

Exercise consisted of interval aerobic training combined with strength exercise in the same training session. The animals trained 60 min/day, 5 days/week for 8 weeks. Body composition, lipid and glycaemic profiles and inflammatory markers were assessed. Results showed that fat mass was reduced in both lean and obese rats following the exercise training (effect size (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 1.8 (0.5-3.0)). Plasma low-density lipoprotein- cholesterol and fasting glucose were lower in the exercise compared to the sedentary groups (d = 2.0 (0.7-3.2) and 1.8 (0.5-3.0), respectively). Plasma insulin was reduced in exercise compared to sedentary groups (d = 2.1 (0.8-3.4)). Some exercise × phenotype interactions showed that the highest decreases in insulin, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, fasting and postprandial glucose were observed in the obese + exercise group (all, P < 0.01).

Participants (n = 27) were divided into three groups according to their training backgrounds (aerobic, strength or concurrent) and submitted to eight sessions: (1) determination of the peak velocity (Vpeak) during the incremental treadmill test to exhaustion and familiarization of the evaluation of maximum strength (1RM) for the half-squat; (2) 1RM determination; and (3-8) randomly assigned experimental sessions consisting of either a strength exercise (SE), four sets at 80% of the 1RM, in which maximum number of repetitions (MNR) and the total volume performed (TV) was computed, and five sessions consisting of high-intensity intermittent aerobic exercise (100% of Vpeak - 1 min:1 min) totaling 5 km, followed by a SE with varying recovery intervals between activities (30, 60 minutes, 4, 8, and 24 hours). Comparisons for MNR and TV were made using two-way variance analysis (group and time interval) with repeated measures in the second factor. When significant differences were detected (P < 0.05), a Bonferroni and Dunnet post-hoc test were used. There was an effect of group for MNR, with the Aerobic Group performing a higher MNR compared to Strength Group (P = 0.002). Moreover, there was an effect of the time interval for MNR and TV, with reduction after 30 (P < 0.001 for both variables) and 60 minutes intervals (P = 0.035; P = 0.007, respectively) compared to the control condition.

The improvements were significantly higher for the E+S group than for the E, S+E, and S groups: 8.6%, 5.7%, 4.7%, and 2.5% for the 4 km test (p<0.05); 10.4%, 8.3%, 8.2%, and 1.6% for VO₂MAX (p<0.01); 13.7%, 10.1 %, 11.0%, and 6.4% for VO₂MAX (ml/kg0.75/min) (p<0.05) respectively. Similar significant results were observed for tlim and the second ventilatory threshold (%VO₂MAX). Conclusions: Circuit training immediately after individualised endurance training in the same session (E+S) produced greater improvement in the 4 km time trial and aerobic capacity than the opposite order or each of the training programmes performed separately.

Subjects performed resistance (sets at maximal effort) and aerobic training (exercises at heart rate corresponding to the second ventilatory threshold) twice a week over 12 weeks, performing both exercise types in the same training session. Upper (elbow flexion) and lower-body (knee extension) one-repetition maximum test (1RM) and peak torque (PT) were evaluated. The muscle thickness (MT) of upper (sum of MT of biceps brachii and brachialis) and lower-body (sum of MT of vastus lateralis , vastus medialis , vastus intermedius , and rectus femoris) was determined by ultrasonography. Moreover, the maximal electromyographic activity (EMG) of upper (biceps brachii) and lower-body (sum of EMG of vastus lateralis and rectus femoris) was measured. Both RA and AR groups increased the upper and lower-body 1RM and PT, while the lower-body 1RM increases observed in the RA was greater than AR (43.58 ± 14.00 vs. 27.01 ± 18.05 %). RA and AR showed MT increases in all muscles evaluated, while the lower-body MT increases observed in the RA were also greater than AR (10.24 ± 3.11 vs. 5.76 ± 1.88 %). There were increases in the maximal EMG of upper and lower-body in both RA and AR, with no differences between groups. Performing resistance prior to aerobic exercise during water-based concurrent training seems to optimize the lower-body strength and hypertrophy.

Controlled studies which involved healthy endurance runners, of any age and sex, were considered. A random-effects model was used to calculate effect sizes (ES; Hedge's g). Means and standard deviations of outcomes were converted to ES with alongside 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Twenty-one moderate-to-high quality studies were included in the meta-analysis, and these included 511 participants. The main analyses revealed a significant moderate improvement in time-trial performance (i.e. distances between 2.0 and 5.0 km; ES = 0.88), without enhancements in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), velocity at VO2max, velocity at submaximal lactate levels, heart rate at submaximal velocities, stride rate at submaximal velocities, stiffness, total body mass or maximal strength performance. However, significant small-to-moderate improvements were noted for jump performance, rate of force development, sprint performance, reactive strength, and running economy (ES = 0.36–0.73; p < 0.001 to 0.031; I2 = 0.0% to 49.3%). JT is effective in improving physical fitness and athletic performance in endurance runners. Improvements in time-trial performance after JT may be mediated through improvements in force generating capabilities and running economy.

Seventeen well-trained rowers (aged 15 ± 1.3 years) were randomly allocated to an intervention (IG) (n = 10) and control group (CG) (n = 7). During 8 weeks, both groups took part in the regular rowing training (3×/week MICT, 70–90 min, 65–70% of HRpeak + 2×/week resistance training). The IG completed an additional high-intensity interval training twice weekly (2 × 4 × 2 min at ≈95% of HRpeak, 60 s rest). Instead of the HIIT, the CG completed two more MICT sessions (70–90 min, 65–70% of HRpeak). Before and after the intervention, a 2000 m time trial and an exercise test were performed. The IG showed a significant improvement (p = 0.001) regarding the absolute rowing time in the graded exercise test. Furthermore, the intervention group showed a significant increase in relative VO2peak (p = 0.023), a significant increase in absolute VO2peak (p = 0.036), and a significant improvement in the 2000 m time trail (p = 0.003). No significant changes could be detected in the CG. The interaction effects were not significant. A mixed-intensity training, including HIIT, was beneficial on rowing performance and VO2peak in highly trained athletes.

Our purpose was to examine the effects of concurrent exercise training on CVD risk factors including peak oxygen uptake ( V ˙ O 2 peak ), C-reactive protein (CRP), asymmetric isomer of dimethylarginine (ADMA), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis. Methods: We performed a 12-week randomized controlled feasibility study examining the effects of a concurrent aerobic and resistance training on the aforementioned variables. Patients (age = 50.1 ± 14 years) randomized to either exercise training group (ET) (2 day/week of aerobic training with 40–60% V ˙ O 2 peak during dialysis; and 2 day/week of resistance training with rating of perceived exertion of 10–15 of 20 during rest), or untrained control group (CON). Results: The employed exercise increased V ˙ O 2 peak (13.8%, p = 0.005) and decreased plasma levels of CRP (− 18.7%, p = 0.01), ADMA (− 9.1%, p = 0.01), FGF-23 (− 10.5%, p = 0.05), and HbA1c (− 7.9%, p = 0.01). Also, the change in V ˙ O 2 peak and HbA1c level in ET group was significantly greater than that of CON group (p = 0.04 and 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: These findings provide compelling evidence that combined aerobic and resistance exercise could be considered as a potent stimulus to induce adaptations in aerobic capacity and decrease CVD risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Participants were tested for dynamic leg press 1-repetition maximum (1RM) and time to exhaustion ( Texh) during an incremental cycle ergometer test both in the morning and evening, cross-sectional area (CSA) of vastus lateralis and diurnal serum testosterone and cortisol concentrations (0730 h; 0930 h; 1630 h; 1830 h). All groups similarly increased 1RM in the morning (14%-19%; p < 0.001) and evening (18%-24%; p < 0.001). CSA increased in all groups by week 24 (12%-20%, p < 0.01); however, during the training weeks 13-24 the evening groups gained more muscle mass (time-of-day main effect; p < 0.05). Texh increased in all groups in the morning (16%-28%; p < 0.01) and evening (18%-27%; p < 0.001), however, a main effect for the exercise order, in favor of E + S, was observed on both testing times ( p < 0.051). Diurnal rhythms in testosterone and cortisol remained statistically unaltered by the training order or time. The present results indicate that combined strength and endurance training in the evening may lead to larger gains in muscle mass, while the E + S training order might be more beneficial for endurance performance development. However, training order and time seem to influence the magnitude of adaptations only when the training period exceeded 12 weeks.

The combined training period lasted for 24 weeks and the participants were divided into the morning training (MG, n = 18), evening training (EG, n = 24) and control groups (CG, n = 10). Isometric leg press force (iLP), maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), sleep behavior, fatigue, time management, motivation, self-esteem and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed. Morning to evening difference in iLP was observed in both MG and EG at Pre and Post, with higher force values in the evening, but not for VO2max. iLP force increased significantly in EG in the morning (p < 0.001) and evening (p = 0.010). VO2max increased in MG and EG both in the morning (both p < 0.001) and in the evening (MG: p < 0.001; EG: p = 0.003). Participants of the present study slept 7–8 h per night and the self-reported sleep duration, get-up time and the average time to go to bed were similar between the groups and did not change from Pre to Post. From HRQoL dimensions, the score for bodily pain decreased in MG (p = 0.029) and significant between-group differences were observed for Pre-Post changes in MG and EG (p = 0.001) as well as between MG and CG (p < 0.001). In vitality, a significant between-group difference was observed for Pre to Post changes in MG and EG (p = 0.014). Perception of time management decreased in EG (p = 0.042) but stayed unchanged for MG and CG. For the intrinsic motivation to participate, significant between-group differences were observed for MG and EG (p = 0.033) and between MG and CG (p = 0.032) for Pre to Post changes. Self-esteem improved in MG (p = 0.029) and EG (p = 0.024). The present combined strength and endurance training program performed in the morning and in the evening led to similar improvements in strength and endurance performance. Training in the morning or in the evening did not disrupt the already good sleep behavior and it was able to further increase the self-esteem. Although training in the morning hours may leave more time for free time activities or social life (i.e. family and friends) compared to the evening training, it might be more challenging to stay motivated to participate in prolonged training programs in the morning hours.

J Strength Cond Res 36(9): 2628–2634, 2022—The aim of this randomized controlled trial study was to compare the effects of 16 weeks of linear periodized and nonperiodized combined training (CT) in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and body composition indicators of adults with obesity. Thirty-four obese adults of both sexes (36.6 ± 4.4 years; body mass index, 32.9 ± 2.7 kg·m−2) were divided into nonperiodized (NG; n = 8), linear periodized (PG; n = 11), and control (CG; n = 15) groups. The NG and PG groups performed 3 weekly sessions of CT over 16 weeks in different ways. Anthropometric measures, maximal strength for leg press and barbell bench press, maximal oxygen uptake (V̇ o 2max), and ventilatory thresholds were determined before and after intervention. The generalized estimation equation was used, with the applied level of significance for the interaction of 0.10 and the isolated effect of time or group or both of 0.05. Significant and similar increases were observed in the 1-repetition maximum test for bench press (NG: 48.8 ± 5.7 to 55.0 ± 6.1 kg; PG: 48.7 ± 5.7 to 53.8 ± 5.9 kg; p = 0.001) and leg press (NG: 235.2 ± 18.7 to 268.3 ± 19.7 kg; PG: 223.1 ± 25.3 to 253.3 ± 23.1 kg; p = 0.05) in trained groups. Relative V̇ o 2max improved only in PG (27.8 ± 1.3 to 32.0 ± 1.4 mL·kg·min−1; p = 0.05), while ventilatory thresholds improved in NG and CG (p = 0.004 and p = 0.06).

Combined training improved maximal upper-body and lower-body strength, regardless of periodization. However, for improvement in V̇ o 2max, linear periodization may be superior to nonperiodization in obese adults.

Therefore, the objective of the current systematic review of experimental and quasiexperimental studies published in the past 10 years was to assess evidence related to acute effects, chronic effects, and both acute and chronic effects of physical exercise on miRNA expression in humans, as well as its functions, evaluated in serum, plasma, whole blood, saliva, or muscle biopsy. For this purpose, the following electronic databases were selected: MEDLINE by Pubmed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and also a manual search in references of the selected articles to April 2017. Experimental and quasiexperimental studies were included. Results indicate that, of the 345 studies retrieved, 40 studies met the inclusion criteria and two articles were included as a result of the manual search. The 42 studies were analyzed, and it can be observed acute and chronic effects of physical exercises (aerobic and resistance) on the expression of several miRNAs in healthy subjects, athletes, young, elderly and in patients with congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type 2 associated with morbid obesity, prediabetic, and patients with intermittent claudication. It is safe to assume that miRNA changes, both in muscle tissues and bodily fluids, are presumably associated with the benefits induced by acute and chronic physical exercise. Thus, a better understanding of changes in miRNAs as a response to physical exercise might contribute to the development of miRNAs as therapeutic targets for the improvement of exercise capacity in individuals with any given disease. However, additional studies are necessary to draw accurate conclusions. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=143864912&site=ehost-live"

It has been shown that jumps of various kinds can also precede the specific session of one's sport, with clear improvements on the various performances of jumping or running. However, it is unclear whether the resulting improvement in explosive performance is because of introduction of a new training regimen or whether it merely reflected the response to an additional training load. Thus, this randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the effect of a combined plyometric and traditional athletics training on speed and explosive strength of the lower limbs. Participant (22 boys, 13-14 yr) were randomly assigned to an 8-wk experimental group (EG, n = 10) who performed plyometric training or a control group (CG, n = 12) who continued their traditional training. The EG performed twice weekly sessions of plyometrics (15 min.), in addition to their standard training without increasing the total training time (90 min.). At baseline and after training all participants were tested on the 20-m sprint (time) and Squat Jump (power, velocity, force and height). The EG group showed significantly (p < 0.05) improvement than CG in the 20-m sprint time (-0.1 vs. 0.1 sec) and Squat Jump (160.8 vs. -31.9 W; 0.3 vs. -0.2 m·s-1; 45.3 vs. -6.3 N; 10.9 vs. -2.2 cm) following training. Eight weeks of plyometric training added to the standard program of athletics was highly likely to improve the lower limbs speed and explosive strength in young athletes. Our findings highlight the potential value of combined training methods in a conditioning program aimed at maximizing power performance in youth.

Thirty-six female basketball players were included in the study and further divided into three groups: plyometric training, n = 11; combined training n =13; and a control group, n =12. Combined training comprised full squat exercise with low resistance (50-65% 1RM) and low volume (3-6 repetitions/set) combined with repeated jumps. Plyometric training included drop jumps and repeated jumps. Both training methods showed a moderate increase in jump performance, although combined training achieved substantially higher values than plyometric training alone. After plyometric training, the vertical velocity and displacement of the center of mass of the countermovement jump increased, while force variables decreased. Combined training increased power, vertical velocity and displacement of the center of mass, but force variables remained unchanged. Both training methods improved jump height, velocity and displacement of the center of mass. Combined training maintained force measures while plyometric training decreased them. These results indicate that combined training might provide better outcomes on jump performance than plyometric training alone. It also appears important to measure biomechanical variables to appropriately interpret the effects of different training methods.

The review documents that 2 × 1 h of recreational football training for 12-16 weeks causes marked improvements in maximal oxygen uptake (5-15%) and myocardial function in women. Moreover, mean arterial blood pressure was shown to decrease by 2-5 mmHg in normotensive women and 6-8 mmHg in hypertensive women. This review also show that short-term (< 4 months) and medium-term (4-16 months) recreational football training has major beneficial impact on metabolic health profile in women, with fat losses of 1-3 kg and improvements in blood lipid profile. Lastly, 2 × 1 h per week of recreational football training for women elevates lower extremity bone mineralisation by 1-5% and whole-body bone mineralization by 1-2% within 4-12-month interventions. These training adaptations are related to the high heart rates, high number of fast runs, and multiple changes of direction and speed occurring during recreational football training for untrained women. In conclusion, regular small-sided football training for women is an intense and versatile type of training that combines elements of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), endurance training and strength training, thereby providing optimal stimuli for cardiovascular, metabolic and musculoskeletal fitness. Recreational football, therefore, seems to be an effective tool for prevention and treatment of lifestyle diseases in young and middle-aged women, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes and osteopenia. Future research should elucidate effects of football training for elderly women, and as treatment and rehabilitation of breast cancer patients and other women patient groups.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of resistance training (RT), concurrent resistance training and aerobic training (RT + AT) on visfatin concentrations and body composition in overweight and obese women. Methods: An eight-week pretest-posttest design with two experimental exercising groups and one control group was used. 45 overweight and obese women were randomized into resistance training (RT), concurrent resistance and aerobic training (RT + AT) or an education-only groups (EDU). All participants received a dietary and education/counselling intervention. However, only the RT and RT + AT group participated in the eight-week exercise training. Results: Repeated measures analysis showed that visfatin was significantly decreased by 8.5% in the RT (P = 0.02) and 29.2% in the RT + AT (P < 0.001), but not in EDU (3.7%; P = 0.22). BMI was decreased in the RT (6.8%; P < 0.001), RT + AT (8.1%; P < 0.001) and EDU (4.4%; P < 0.001), while BF% decreased in the RT (6.9%; P = 0.001), RT + AT (13.1%; P= 0.001), and EDU (4.9%; P = 0.020). WHR was decreased in the RT (2.4%; P = 0.001), in the RT + AT (4.2%; P = 0.002) and EDU (2.5%; P = 0.02). VO2max (mL.kg-1.min-1) increased in the RT (16.3%; P = 0.004), RT + AT (37.7%; P = 0.001), but not in EDU (7.2%; P = 0.72). The absolute value of VO2max (L.min-1) also significantly increased in RT + AT (0.25%; P < 0.05) compared to baseline, but did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: While RT and education-alone improved body composition and aerobic capacity, structured regular exercise incorporating both RT and AT may be required to improve visfatin and VO2max in overweight and obese females.

Researchers used Mayhew regression equation to establish the values of upper extremity. Results show that the muscular strength of the RT group increased for all exercises while no changes were detected in the ET group. Accordingly, the RT group showed greater gains in their peak WAnT power with 15.6% compared to 2.6% of the ET group.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=39753954&site=ehost-live"

Following prescreening, 102 subjects underwent anthropometric measurements, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and strength and aerobic exercise testing. Randomized subjects (male RET, n = 16; female RET, n = 19; male AET, n = 16; and female AET, n = 25) completed supervised and periodized exercise programs (AET, 30-50 min cycling at 70%-75% maximal heart rate; RET, 2-4 sets × 8-10 repetitions of 5-7 exercises at 70%-75% 1 repetition maximum) or a nonexercising control condition (male CON, n = 13 and female CON, n = 13). Changes in absolute and relative TB-FM and TB-FFM and ROI-FM and ROI-FFM were determined. At baseline, and although matched for age and body mass index, males had greater strength, aerobic fitness, body mass, absolute and relative TB-FFM and ROI-FFM, but reduced absolute and relative TB-FM and ROI-FM, compared with females ( p < 0.05). After training, both female exercise groups showed equivalent or greater relative improvements in strength and aerobic fitness than did the male exercise groups ( p < 0.05); however, the male exercise groups increased TB-FFM and reduced TB-FM more than did the female exercise groups ( p < 0.05). Male AET altered absolute FM more than male RET altered absolute FFM, thus resulting in a greater enhancement of relative FFM. Despite equivalent or greater responses to RET or AET by female subjects, the corresponding respective increases in FFM or reductions in FM were lower than those in males, indicating that a biased dose-response relationship exists between sexes following 10 weeks of exercise training.

Design: This study is a randomized controlled 12-wk intervention trial with a 1 -yr follow-up. Forty-three community-dwelling independent walkers with a chronic ischemic hemiparetic stroke were allocated to AT using a cycle ergometer (n = 13), RT using training machines (n = 14), or low-intensity sham training of the arms (n = 1 6). The main outcome measures were 6-min walk distance and fast 10-m walking speed. Results: Comparisons between AT, RT, and sham training revealed no clinically relevant effects on walking velocity or walking distance. Muscle strength improved after RT (P<0.00001) and was preserved at 1-yr follow-up (P<0.00001). Aerobic capacity increased after AT (P<0.001) but was lost during the follow-up observation period. Conclusions: Improvement of muscle strength or aerobic capacity using non- task-specific training methods does not result in improved ambulation in patients with chronic stroke. Muscle strength gains were maintained at follow-up, whereas all improvements of aerobic capacity were lost, indicating a long-lasting effect of intensive RT even without maintenance training.

Thirty-four players (age: 23.7 ± 4.1 years; height: 1.77 ± 0.06 m; body mass: 74.1 ± 8.2 kg) were randomly assigned into three groups: full squat group (SG, n = 12), combined full squat and CD group (S + CDG, n = 12), and control group (CG, n = 10). The RT for SG consisted of full squat with low-load (-45-60 % 1RM) and lowvolume (2-3 sets and 4-6 repetitions), whereas the S + CDG performed the same RT program combined with loaded CD (2-5 sets of 10 s). Estimated one-repetition maximum (1RMest) and variables derived from RSA test including mean sprint time (RSAmean), best sprint time (RSAbest), percent sprint decrement (Sdec), mean ground contact time (GCTmean) and mean step length (SL) were selected as testing variables. Changes in sprint time and GCT in each sprint were also analysed. Both experimental groups showed significant (P < 0.050.001) improvements for 1RMest, RSAbest and first and second sprint time. In addition, S + CDG achieved significant (P < 0.050.001) improvements in RSAmean, sprint time (from fifth to ninth sprint) and GCT (from third to eighth sprint). These results indicate that only 6 weeks of low-load and low-volume RT combined with CD in addition to routine futsal training is enough to improve RSA and strength performance simultaneously in futsal players.

J Strength Cond Res 36(3): 796-804, 2022-Supplementary (i.e. concurrent) resistance training can enhance cycling performance among competitive cyclists. However, a lack of knowledge exists about the retention (decay profile) in mechanical muscle function and cycling performance after concurrent resistance and endurance training. The present exploratory intervention study investigated the effect of 6 weeks of resistance training cessation when preceded by 8 weeks of concurrent resistance and endurance training on mechanical muscle function and cycling performance in 9 male well-trained competitive cyclists (V[Combining Dot Above]O2max = 66 +/- 7 ml[middle dot]min-1[middle dot]kg-1). Cyclists performed periodized resistance training targeting leg and core muscles for 8 weeks as a supplement to their normal endurance (cycling) training. This was followed by 6 weeks of endurance training only (retention period) leading up to the start of the competitive season. Maximal leg extensor power, isometric leg extensor strength (maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]), rate of force development (RFD), and long-term cycling performance (2-hour submaximal cycling at 55% of Wmax), followed by 5-minute max cycling were evaluated. After 8 weeks of concurrent resistance and endurance training, leg extensor power, MVC, and RFD increased by 12, 15, and 17%, respectively while mean power output (W) during 5-minute max cycling increased by 7% (p < 0.05). Training-induced gains in MVC and 5-minute max cycling power were retained after 6-week cessation of resistance training (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that competitive cyclists can focus on cycling training alone for at least 6 weeks leading up to competition without losing attained gains in maximal muscle strength and cycling performance achieved by preceding periods of concurrent resistance training.

Further, the influence of concurrent SE training on muscle fiber-type composition, vascularization and endurance capacity remains unknown in top-level endurance athletes. The present study examined the effect of 16 weeks of concurrent SE training on maximal muscle strength (MVC), contractile rate of force development (RFD), muscle fiber morphology and composition, capillarization, aerobic power (VO2max), cycling economy (CE) and long/short-term endurance capacity in young elite competitive cyclists ( n=14). MVC and RFD increased 12-20% with SE ( P<0.01) but not E. VO2max remained unchanged. CE improved in E to reach values seen in SE. Short-term (5-min) endurance performance increased (3-4%) after SE and E ( P<0.05), whereas 45-min endurance capacity increased (8%) with SE only ( P<0.05). Type IIA fiber proportions increased and type IIX proportions decreased after SE training ( P<0.05) with no change in E. Muscle fiber area and capillarization remained unchanged. In conclusion, concurrent strength/endurance training in young elite competitive cyclists led to an improved 45-min time-trial endurance capacity that was accompanied by an increased proportion of type IIA muscle fibers and gains in MVC and RFD, while capillarization remained unaffected.

Sarcopenia (i.e. muscle atrophy) and loss of strength are known to occur with age. While its aetiology is poorly understood, the multifactorial sequelae of sarcopenia are well documented and present a major public health concern to our aging population, as both the quality of life and the likelihood of age-associated declines in health status are influenced. These age-related declines in health include decreased energy expenditure at rest and during exercise, and increased body fat and its accompanying increased dyslipidaemia and reduced insulin sensitivity. Quality of life is affected by reduced strength and endurance and increased difficulty in being physically active. Strength and muscle mass are increased following resistance training in older adults through a poorly understood series of events that appears to involve the recruitment of satellite cells to support hypertrophy of mature myofibres. Muscle quality (strength relative to muscle mass) also increases with resistance training in older adults possibly for a number of reasons, including increased ability to neurally activate motor units and increased high-energy phosphate availability. Resistance training in older adults also increases power, reduces the difficulty of performing daily tasks, enhances energy expenditure and body composition, and promotes participation in spontaneous physical activity. Impairment in strength development may result when aerobic training is added to resistance training but can be avoided with training limited to 3 days/week.

A database search was carried out in PubMed, Science Direct, OvidSPMedLine, Wiley, Web of Science, ProQuest and Google Scholar. In accordance with the PRISMA checklist, 18 published articles dated prior to May 2016 involving 321 endurance runners were reviewed using the PEDro scale. Resistance training led to general improvements in muscular strength, running economy, muscle power factors, and direct performance in distances between 1,500 and 10,000 m. Such improvements were not accompanied by a significant increase in body mass or signs of overtraining. However, improvements did not occur in all cases, suggesting that they might depend on the specific characteristics of the resistance training applied. Although current evidence supports the effectiveness of resistance training to improve performance in already trained endurance runners, the methodological inconsistencies identified suggest that the results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies ought to investigate the benefits of resistance training in endurance runners while considering the existence of possible differentiated effects based on the specific characteristics of the resistance training carried out.

Results: Intragroup improvement in QoL was observed for the physical health of RT+MP. The Cooper test showed improvement in the prediction test for both groups. Functional autonomy improved in the following: rising from a ventral decubitus position, rising from a sitting position, walking 10 meters, putting on and taking off a t-shirt (PTTs) and the GDLAM index (GI) in the RT+MP group. For RT+TC, PTTs and GI improved. With respect to strength, there was intragroup improvement in the RT+MP group for all upper limb exercises, knee flexion and 45° leg press. On the other hand, the RT+TC group showed improvements in high shoulder adduction, elbow extension, low shoulder adduction, pec deck pectorals and 45° leg press. Intergroup analysis showed better results in the 10mW test for RT+MP. Conclusion: Both methods showed significant improvements in functional autonomy and muscle strength, as well as maintenance of QoL and cardiorespiratory capacity. Intergroup analysis indicated better results with the RT+MP program. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=135221661&site=ehost-live"

Eighteen active females were matched according to leg strength and repeated-sprint ability and randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group performed resistance training with 20-s rest intervals between sets, while the other group employed 80-s rest intervals between sets. Both groups performed the same total training volume and load. Each group trained 3 days a week for 5 weeks [15- to 20-repetition maximum (RM), 2 - 5 sets]. Repeated-sprint ability (5×6-s maximal cycle sprints), 3-RM leg press strength, and anthropometry were determined before and after each training programme. There was a greater improvement in repeated-sprint ability after training with 20-s rest intervals (12.5%) than after training with 80-s rest intervals (5.4%) (P = 0.030). In contrast, there were greater improvements in strength after training with 80-s rest intervals (45.9%) than after training with 20-s rest intervals (19.6%) (P = 0.010). There were no changes in anthropometry for either group following training. These results suggest that when training volume and load are matched, despite a smaller increase in strength, 5 weeks of training with short rest periods results in greater improvements in repeated-sprint ability than the same training with long rest periods.

A prescription of exercise designed to meet a patient's individual needs with minimal supervision from healthcare practitioners would facilitate this. However, the optimal prescription of exercise in the population remains unclear. Objective: This review examines the effects planned self-directed exercise has on glycosylated haemoglobin and other outcomes in individuals with T2DM and aims to identify the most suitable forms of planned self-directed exercise for individuals with T2DM that can be carried out independently. Methods: A search of the electronic databases PubMed, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane (Trials) and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted along with reference lists of previous reviews. Randomised controlled trials published in English between January 1990 and February 2015 examining participants diagnosed with T2DM only were included. Studies were critically appraised using the PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale and data were presented on standardised tables. Results: Twenty-eight articles that used five element gymnastics, a games console exercise intervention (Wii fit plus) or aerobic, resistance or combined training were included. Conclusion: This review comprehensively summarised the effects planned self-directed exercise interventions had on individuals with T2DM. The review found that self-directed exercise was found to be beneficial for individuals with T2DM for improving glycosylated haemoglobin, physical characteristics, cardiorespiratory fitness, functional measures and other metabolic outcomes.

A recent review indicates that the interferences are associated with ET duration. The purpose of this study was to examine whether short duration sprint interval training following resistance training (RT) influences the training response in regard to muscle strength and hypertrophy in untrained men. Methods: Twenty untrained men participated in this study. We divided the subjects into a resistance training group (R, n=6) and a concurrent training group (C, n=6). The RT program designed to induce muscular hypertrophy (3 sets x 10 reps at 80%1RM of arm curl) was carried out 3 times per week on nonconsecutive days for a period of 8 weeks by both groups. In addition to RT, subjects assigned to the C group performed, a modified sprint interval training (4 sets of 30 second maximal effort, separated by 4.5 minute rest intervals) immediately after RT. Pre- and post-test of V02max, cross sectional area (CSA) and one repetition maximum (1RM) were measured. Results: Significant increases in V02max from pre- to post-test were observed in the C group (p=0.010, ES=1.84), but not in the R group (p=0.559, ES=0.33). Significant increases in CSA from pre- to post-test were observed in the R group (p=0.030, ES=1.38), but not in the C group (p=0.110, ES=0.88). Significant increases in 1RM from pre- to post-test were observed in the R group (p=0.021, ES=1.52), but not in the C group (p=0.065, ES=1.15). Conclusion: Our data indicates that short duration high-intensity ET interferes with strength and hypertrophy gains.

"Effects of Short-Term Concurrent Training Cessation on the Energy Cost of Running and Neuromuscular Performances in Middle-Distance Runners.","Berryman, Nicolas; Mujika, Iñigo; Bosquet, Laurent","Sports (2075-4663)",="20754663",,="20210101","9","1","1","1","148210734",,,"Article","STRENGTH training; WEIGHT training; LONG-distance running; COACH-athlete relationships; RUNNING; RUNNING training",,"Evidence supports the implementation of concurrent strength and running training, within the same mesocycle, to improve performances in middle- and long-distance events. However, very little is known about the effects of concurrent training cessation. The purpose of this investigation was to describe the effects of 4 weeks of explosive strength training cessation after an 8-week concurrent training protocol. Eight runners completed this study, which first included either plyometric (n = 4) or dynamic weight training (n = 4) in addition to the usual running regimen. Explosive strength training was thereafter interrupted for 4 weeks, during which running sessions were maintained. Participants were tested at baseline, after concurrent training and after concurrent training cessation. The results suggest that the energy cost of running improvements observed after the intervention (−5.75%; 95% CI = −8.47 to −3.03) were maintained once explosive strength training was interrupted (−6.31%; 95% CI = −10.30 to −2.32). The results also suggest that neuromuscular performances were maintained after 4 weeks of concurrent training cessation, especially when tests were specific to the training intervention. Furthermore, a 3000m time trial revealed a similar pattern, with improvements after the concurrent mesocycle (−2.40%; 95% CI = −4.65 to −0.16) and after concurrent training cessation (−4.43%; 95% CI = −6.83 to −2.03). Overall, only trivial changes were observed for aerobic endurance and V ˙ O 2 p e a k . Together, these results suggest that short-term explosive strength training cessation might be beneficial and could be considered as a taper strategy for middle-distance runners. However, coaches and athletes must interpret these results cautiously considering the study's low sample size and the very limited available literature in this domain.

The exercise group trained three sessions a week. Each session consisted of a warm-up period, 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, 10 minutes of resistance training with five leg muscle exercises (two sets of 10-12 repetitions at 50-70% of 1RM for each activity), and a cool-down period. The variables of body composition, glycemic control, lipid profile, and functional capacity were measured before and after the study period. Exercise training decreased waist-hip ratio and body fat of the trained subjects. Concentrations of fasting and 2-hour post-glucose challenge plasma glucose and serum insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin decreased significantly in the exercise group. Exercise training improved the lipid profile and also increased the leg muscle strength and 6-minute walking distance of the trained subjects. The control group, however, increased their body fat and fasting plasma glucose, while other variables were not changed during the study period. The current results demonstrate that elderly patients with a long history of type 2 diabetes can benefit from the 6-month combined aerobic and resistance training program.

The aim of this review, therefore, is to determine the magnitude of deconditioning of the musculoskeletal system during prolonged spaceflight and recommend possible methods to enhance the existing countermeasures. Methods: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Ovid and Scopus databases. 5541 studies were identified prior to the removal of duplicates and the application of the following inclusion criteria: (1) group means and standard deviations for pre- and post-spaceflight for measures of strength, muscle mass or bone density were reported (or provided by the corresponding author when requested via e-mail), (2) exercise-based countermeasures were included, (3) the population of the studies were human, (4) muscle function was assessed and (5) spaceflight rather than simulated spaceflight was used. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using a modified Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale for quality, with publication bias assessed using a failsafe N (Rosenthal method), and consistency of studies analysed using I2 as a test of heterogeneity. Secondary analysis of studies included Hedges' g effect sizes, and between-study differences were estimated using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Heterogeneity of the completed meta-analyses was conducted revealing homogeneity for bone mineral density (BMD) and spinal muscle size (Tau2 < 0.001; I2 = 0.00%, p > 0.05), although a high level of heterogeneity was noted for lower body force production (Tau2 = 1.546; I2 = 76.03%, p < 0.001) and lower body muscle mass (Tau2 = 1.386; I2 = 74.38%, p < 0.001). The estimated variance (≤ -0.306) for each of the meta-analyses was significant (p ≤ 0.033), for BMD (− 0.48 to − 0.53, p < 0.001), lower body force production (− 1.75, p < 0.001) and lower body muscle size (− 1.98, p < 0.001). Spaceflight results in small reductions in BMD of the femur (Hedges g = − 0.49 [− 0.69 to – 0.28]), trochanter (Hedges g = − 0.53 [− 0.77 to – 0.29]), and lumbo-pelvic region (Hedges g = − 0.48 [− 0.73 to – 0.23]), but large decreases in lower limb force production (Hedges g = − 1.75 [− 2.50 to – 0.99]) and lower limb muscle size (Hedges g = − 1.98 [− 2.72 to – 1.23]). Conclusions: Current exercise countermeasures result in small reductions in BMD during long-duration spaceflight. In contrast, such exercise protocols do not alleviate the reductions in muscle function or muscle size, which may be attributable to the low to moderate loads reported by crewmembers and the interference effect associated with concurrent training. It is recommended that higher-load resistance exercise and the use of high-intensity interval training should be investigated, to determine if such modifications to the reported training practices result in more effective countermeasures to the deleterious effect of long-duration spaceflight on the muscular system.

While there is an agreement on specific endurance training for typical endurance sports such as running, swimming and cycling, there is a need for discussion for sports with short-term high-intensity exercise like artistic gymnastics. Purpose. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gymnasticsspecific high intensity interval training on endurance performance on the pommel horse and the arm ergometer. Materials and methods. Endurance performance on the pommel horse was determined by the maximum number of circles, endurance performance on the arm ergometer by peak power and power at the ventilatory thresholds 1 and 2. In addition, the effect on oxygen uptake, peak blood lactate concentration and peak heart rate on the pommel horse and arm ergometer should be investigated. Eleven gymnasts (age: 15.27 ± 2.49 years; weight: 55.5 ± 12.8 kg; height: 163.5 ± 12.2 cm) from a local gymnastics club performed high intensity interval training 2 times per week for 4 weeks. The high intensity interval training consisted of ten 40 s intervals (2 x 5 upper body exercises with 90% of the maximum heart rate) and a rest period of 60 s between each interval. Results. The maximum number of circles (56.0 to 66.5), peak power (160.5 to 194.5 W), power at the ventilatory thresholds 1 (79.0 to 104.5 W) and power at the ventilatory thresholds 2 (132.5 to 156.0 W) increased significantly from pre- to post-test. Peak oxygen uptake shows a significant decrease on the arm ergometer (47.2 to 43.1 ml/min/kg), but no significant change on the pommel horse (42.9 to 43.2 ml/min/kg). Peak blood lactate concentration and peak heart rate show no change from pre to post test on the pommel horse and arm ergometer. Conclusions. The results of the study show that gymnastics-specific high intensity interval training is a timeefficient training method for improving upper body and pommel horse-specific endurance performance.

A randomised, between-groups design was employed with 30 recreationally resistance-trained males completing one of four acute experimental training protocols; strength training (ST), strength followed by endurance training (ST-END), endurance followed by strength training (END-ST) or no training (CON). Blood samples were taken before each respective exercise protocol, immediately upon cessation of exercise, and 1 h post cessation of exercise. Blood samples were subsequently analysed for total testosterone, cortisol and lactate concentrations. Ability to maintain 80% 1RM during strength training was better in ST and ST-END than END-ST (bothp < .05). Immediately following the respective exercise protocols all training interventions elicited significant increases in testosterone (p < .05). ST and END-ST resulted in greater increases in cortisol than ST-END (bothp < .05). The testosterone:cortisol ratio was similar following the respective exercise protocols. Blood lactate concentrations post-training were greater following END-ST and ST than ST-END (bothp < .05). Conducting endurance exercise prior to strength training resulted in impaired strength training performance. Blood cortisol and lactate concentrations were greater when endurance training was conducted prior to strength training thanvice versa. As such, it may be suggested that conducting endurance prior to strength training may result in acute unfavourable responses to strength training when strength training is conducted with high loads.

The healthy men ( n=63) were randomized into endurance (E), strength (S), combined strength and endurance training (SE) and control (C) groups. S and E trained two times a week and SE 2+2 times a week. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly both in E (−6±8 and −4±6 mmHg) and in S (−9±8 and −5±7 mmHg), but not in SE or C ( P=0.003 for the difference in the changes of SBP between the groups). The changes in serum glucose and insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test did not differ between the groups. Only E decreased serum fasting insulin levels (−17±27%, P=0.013). Minor changes were observed in blood lipids and lipoproteins in all groups. Both endurance and strength training can modestly improve metabolic health even in relatively lean older men with normal glucose tolerance. Combined strength and endurance training did not produce complementary benefits on metabolic risk factors. Combined training is effective in improving body composition and cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, however, which is likely to decrease the risk of future metabolic and cardiovascular disease.

Some data suggest an attenuated cardiovascular and musculoskeletal response to combined E and S training, while other data show unimpaired or even superior adaptation compared with either training regime alone. However, the effect of concurrent S and E training only rarely has been examined in top-level endurance athletes. This review describes the effect of concurrent SE training on short-term and long-term endurance performance in endurance-trained subjects, ranging from moderately trained individuals to elite top-level athletes. It is concluded that strength training can lead to enhanced long-term (>30 min) and short-term (<15 min) endurance capacity both in well-trained individuals and highly trained top-level endurance athletes, especially with the use of high-volume, heavy-resistance strength training protocols. The enhancement in endurance capacity appears to involve training-induced increases in the proportion of type IIA muscle fibers as well as gains in maximal muscle strength (MVC) and rapid force characteristics (rate of force development), while likely also involving enhancements in neuromuscular function.

Despite no changes in treadmill VO2max or cycle peak VO2, a 33 plus/minus 5 percent increase (P less than 0.001) in cycling time to exhaustion at 75 percent of peak VO2 was observed following training. No significant changes in cycling time were observed in the control group. There were significant reductions in plasma lactate concentration at all relative exercise intensities ranging between 55 and 75 percent of peak VO2 training. The improved endurance performance was associated with a 12 percent increase in LT (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001). the strength training program resulted in significant improvements (P less than 0.001) of 31 plus/minus 5 percent and 35 plus/minus 7 percent in isokinetic peak torque values for leg extension and flexion, respectively, at a velocity of 30 degrees.s-1. There were also significant increases in 1-RM values of 30 plus/minus 4 percent (P less than 0.001) for leg extension, 52 plus/minus 6 percent (P less than 0.001) for leg flexion, and 20 plus/minus 4 percent (P less than 0.001) for the bench press. These findings indicate that strength training improves cycle endurance performance independently of changes in VO2max. This improved performance appears to be related to increases in LT and leg strength.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH277660&site=ehost-live"

However, the effects on adolescent (<18 yr) runners remains elusive. This randomized control trial aimed to examine the effect of strength training on several important physiological and neuromuscular qualities associated with distance running performance. Methods: Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 25, 13 female, 17.2 ± 1.2 yr) were paired according to their sex and RE and randomly assigned to a 10-wk strength training group (STG) or a control group who continued their regular training. The STG performed twice weekly sessions of plyometric, sprint, and resistance training in addition to their normal running. Outcome measures included body mass, maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O2max), speed at V˙O2max, RE (quantified as energy cost), speed at fixed blood lactate concentrations, 20-m sprint, and maximal voluntary contraction during an isometric quarter-squat. Results: Eighteen participants (STG: <italic>n</italic> = 9, 16.1 ± 1.1 yr; control group: <italic>n</italic> = 9, 17.6 ± 1.2 yr) completed the study. The STG displayed small improvements (3.2%–3.7%; effect size (ES), 0.31–0.51) in RE that were inferred as “possibly beneficial” for an average of three submaximal speeds. Trivial or small changes were observed for body composition variables, V˙O2max and speed at V˙O2max; however, the training period provided likely benefits to speed at fixed blood lactate concentrations in both groups. Strength training elicited a very likely benefit and a possible benefit to sprint time (ES, 0.32) and maximal voluntary contraction (ES, 0.86), respectively. Conclusions: Ten weeks of strength training added to the program of a postpubertal distance runner was highly likely to improve maximal speed and enhances RE by a small extent, without deleterious effects on body composition or other aerobic parameters.

Sixteen well-trained runners (27.4 � 4.4 years; 62.7 � 4.3 kg; 166.1 � 5.0 cm), were randomized into two groups: explosive strength training (EST) (n = 9) and heavy weight strength training (HWT) (n = 7) group. They performed the following tests before and after 4 weeks of training: 1) incremental treadmill test to exhaustion to determine of peak oxygen uptake and the velocity corresponding to 3.5 mM of blood lactate concentration; 2) submaximal constant-intensity test to determine RE; 3) maximal countermovement jump test and; 4) one repetition maximal strength test in leg press. After the training period, there was an improvement in RE only in the HWT group (HWT = 47.3 � 6.8 vs. 44.3 � 4.9 ml � kg−1 � min−1; EST = 46.4 � 4.1 vs. 45.5 � 4.1 ml � kg−1 � min−1). In conclusion, a short period of traditional strength training can improve RE in well-trained runners, but this improvement can be dependent on the strength training characteristics. When comparing to explosive training performed in the same equipment, heavy weight training seems to be more efficient for the improvement of RE.

During the 16 weeks of training, significant increases were observed in 1RMHS in M46 and M64 (41-45 %; p &lt; 0.001). The muscle CSAQF increased (13-11 %; p &gt; 0.01) for both groups. The first 8 weeks of training led to significant increases in Wmax (6-11 %; p &lt; 0.001) and decreases in submaximal (LA) in both groups, but no further training-induced changes were observed during the subsequent 8 weeks of training. Statistically significant relationships were observed in M64 and in the combined group M46 + M64 between the training-induced changes observed in Wmax and serum testosterone-cortisol and free-testosterone-cortisol ratios, whereas in M46 the respective correlations values did not reach statistically significant levels. These data indicate that strength training results in a significant improvement in maximal and submaximal endurance during the first 8 weeks of strength training in both age groups, related in part to the intensity and the volume of resistance training used and to the training status of the subjects. The relationships found in this study between various indices of cycling testing and serum hormone concentrations after strength training suggest that maximal incremental cycling might be used as an additional test to detect anabolic-catabolic responses to prolonged strength training in middle-aged and older men.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-878391&site=ehost-live"

J Strength Cond Res 25(3): 758-766, 2011-The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of concurrent training on endurance capacity and dynamic neuromuscular economy in elderly men. Twenty-three healthy men (65 ± 4 years) were divided into 3 groups: concurrent (CG, n = 8), strength (SG, n = 8), and aerobic training group (EG, n = 7). Each group trained 3 times a week for 12 weeks, strength training, aerobic training, or both types of training in the same session. The maximum aerobic workload (Wmax) and peak oxygen uptake (O2peak) of the subjects were evaluated on a cycle ergometer before and after the training period. Moreover, during the maximal test, muscle activation was measured at each intensity by means of electromyographic signals from the vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris long head, and gastrocnemius lateralis to determine the dynamic neuromuscular economy. After training, significant increases in O2peak and Wmax were only found in the CG and EG (p < 0.05), with no difference between groups. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in myoelectric activity of the RF muscle at 50 (EG), 75 and 100 W (EG and CG) and in the VL for the 3 groups at 100 W (p < 0.05). No change was seen in the electrical signal from the lateral gastrocnemius muscle and biceps femoris. The results suggest specificity in adaptations investigated in elderly subjects, because the most marked changes in the neuromuscular economy occurred in the aerobically trained groups.

Twenty-five male runners (38.2 ± 7.1 years; body mass index: 23.0 ± 1.1 kg⋅m-2;VO2max: 55.4 ± 4.0 mlO2⋅kg-1⋅min-1) were divided into an exercise (EG= 13) and control group (CG= 12). Before and after a 12-week SEP training, Cr, spring-mass model parameters at four speeds (8, 10, 12, 14 km⋅h-1) were calculated and maximal muscle power (MMP) of the lower limbs was measured. In EG, Cr decreased significantly (p < .05) at all tested running speeds (-6.4 ± 6.5% at 8 km⋅h-1; -3.5 ± 5.3% at 10 km⋅h-1; -4.0 ± 5.5% at 12 km⋅h-1; -3.2 ± 4.5% at 14 km⋅h-1), contact time (tc) increased at 8, 10 and 12 km⋅h-1 by mean +4.4 ± 0.1% and ta decreased by -25.6 ± 0.1% at 8 km⋅h-1 (p < .05). Further, inverse relationships between changes in Cr and MMP at 10 (p = .013; r = -0.67) and 12 km⋅h-1 (p < .001; r =-0.86) were shown. Conversely, no differences were detected in the CG in any of the studied parameters. Thus, 12-week SEP training programme lower the Cr in well-trained ultra-marathoners at submaximal speeds. Increased tc and an inverse relationship between changes in Cr and changes in MMP could be in part explain the decreased Cr. Thus, adding at least three sessions per week of SEP exercises in the normal endurance-training programme may decrease the Cr.

The primary aim of this study was to examine whether a supervised treadmill-walking program would improve calf-muscle strength and endurance in individuals with PAD. Design: The study included two stages. The first 12-week period was a nonexercise, within-subject control stage and the second 12-week period was an exercise training stage. Setting: Southern Cross University, Australia. Subjects: Twenty-two subjects with stable intermittent claudication were recruited. Their resting and postexercise ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure index (ABI) was 0.61 +/- 0.13 and 0.41 +/- 0.22, respectively. Interventions: Subjects trained in the laboratory, 3 sessions per week for 12 weeks. Outcome measurements: Walking capacity, calf-muscle strength (peak torques in isokinetic plantar flexion at velocities of 30 degrees per second, 60 degrees per second, and 90 degree per second) and endurance (mean peak force, total work, and mean power in repeated maximal plantar flexions at 60 degrees per second), ABI, and peak oxygen uptake were measured at the baseline and the end of each stage. Results: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures indicated that the supervised treadmill-walking program significantly increased calf-muscle strength and endurance. Walking capacity and peak oxygen uptake also showed significant improvements following the training program. Significant correlation was found between the improved calf-muscle endurance and walking capacity. Conclusion: Supervised treadmill exercise is highly effective in improving walking capacity. The improved walking capacity is accompanied by improved calf-muscle strength and endurance in individuals with PAD.

For this reason, the primary aim of this research is to determine the effects of the intrasession exercise sequence of concurrent training on older women's body composition and physical fitness. The present study was conducted under a randomized experimental design. The population sample consisted of 38 physically inactive women aged between 60 and 75 years. These women were randomly assigned to one of the training groups: strength + endurance (SE, n = 19) or endurance + strength (ES, n = 19.) The intervention was the same for both training groups; the only difference was the exercise sequence of both components: one group first trained strength and then endurance, and the other did the opposite. The variables evaluated before and after the intervention were body composition and physical fitness. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine statistically significant differences in pre- and post-test means within each group. Cohen's d effect size was also calculated to determine the magnitude of the group differences. The ES group had significant differences in mass (p = 0.036, d = 0.834), fat percentage (p = 0.044, d = 0.419), arm curl (p = 0.041, d = 1.429), step (p = 0.023, d = 1.423), and grip strength (p = 0.001, d = 0.831). The SE group reported significant differences in mass (p = 0.035, d = 0.545), fat percentage (p = 0.023, d = 0.882), muscle percentage (p = 0.001, d = 3.536), chair stand (p = 0.001, d = 2.579), arm curl (p = 0.001, d = 1.530), step (p = 0.001, d = 1.369), and grip strength (p = 0.001, d = 0.85). When comparing the effects of the two interventions, strength followed by endurance training was more effective in: fat percentage, arm curl, chair sit-and-reach (cm) the muscle percentage and chair stand variables. The main conclusion of this research is that concurrent training starting with strength followed by endurance, in older women, is more effective in improving body composition and physical condition compared to endurance training followed by strength.

Methods: Forty-seven young male soccer players (age: 15.5 ± 0.9 years) were distributed into three groups. Two groups performed the same training volume with both legs, beginning with the weaker leg (Stronger Volume Weaker leg group (SVW), n = 14) or with the stronger leg (Stronger Volume Stronger leg group, (SVS), n = 15). The third group executed double the volume with the weaker leg and also commenced with such leg (Double Volume Weaker leg group (DVW), n = 16) during a 10-week period. Pre- and post-intervention tests included a single-leg hop, single-leg lateral hop, triple hop, bilateral and unilateral countermovement jumps, a change of direction speed test, concentric and eccentric mean power during the lateral squat test, and their corresponding asymmetries. Results: Single-leg hop weaker leg, triple hop weaker leg, and bilateral countermovement jump improvements were achieved in the SVW (ES: 0.29 to 0.46) and DVW (ES: 0.55 to 0.73) groups. Between-groups analysis showed better results in single-leg hop in the SVW and DVW compared to group SVS. The DVW group achieved better improvements in countermovement jump in comparison to groups SVS and SVW. Conclusions: Groups that started with the weaker leg seemed to achieve a greater volume of significant changes than when starting with the stronger leg. Performing a double volume on the weaker limb does not guarantee further improved performance compared to other groups.

The purpose of this study was to determine leptin and some coronary heart disease risk factor responses in young females after aerobic and resistance exercise training and low caloric diet. Methods: Thirty-six inactive obese girls volunteered to participate in the study. They were divided to four equal aerobic training, resistance training, low caloric diet and control groups. Fast blood samples were collected at baseline, after 4 and 8 weeks. Exercise groups had 8-week programs, three sessions aerobic (60 min cycling at 60–70 % of Vo 2max) or resistance (12 exercises, 4 sets, 15 repetitions, 60 % of 1RM) training per week. Results: Significant decrease was observed in low caloric diet group from pre-test to 4 and 8 weeks ( p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in serum leptin, within other groups ( p > 0.05). There was a significant difference between low caloric diet and control group in serum leptin from pre-test to post-test ( p < 0.05). No significant differences ( p > 0.05) were observed between groups on serum insulin, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and glucose at any trails. Significant decrease in glucose was observed within diet group from pre- to 4- and 8-week test ( p < 0.05). Conclusion: Main finding of this study is that 8 weeks aerobic and resistance training was not sufficient to produce favorite changes on serum leptin and metabolic parameters. It seems that low caloric diet may reduce serum leptin. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=91928890&site=ehost-live"

Assessments were made with routine tests (i.e., squat jumps [SJs], countermovement jumps [CMJs], and countermovement jumps with arm swing [CMJas]) at the end of each macrocycle, and the Probst test was used to assess aerobic endurance as a function of running speed and distance, at the start and end of the training schedule and at the start of the third macrocycle. Jumps were performed on an infrared platform fitted to the MuscleLab system. The Probst test showed differences between the first evaluation and the second and third evaluations: 3,550 +/- 411.59 m vs. 2,006 +/- 207.20 m (P < 0.01). For 2 of the 3 jumps analyzed, the results were better in the last 2 than in the first 2 evaluations (SJ, 43.13 +/- 3.77 vs. 39.47 +/- 3.4 [P < 0.05]; CMJ, 49.80 +/- 3.77 vs. 46.67 +/- 3.76 [P < 0.05]; CMJas, 56.24 +/- 5.2 vs. 52.98 +/- 4.54 [P > 0.05]). Improvement of aerobic endurance was produced on the first phase of the season as a consequence of the training. To increase strength, it is necessary to augment the number of training sessions of this type. It is convenient to separate aerobic endurance and strength training to create more ample blocks during the last 2 macrocycles.

Two methods were applied—aerobic training (TA) and circuit training (TCIRC)—and their effects were compared on the quality of life of patients through diagnostic tests for fibromyalgia (questionnaire on the impact of fibromyalgia, visual scale of pain), development of aerobic capacity (test time, VO2max, and HRmax), and strength (15RM test). With the analysis performed in the pre- and post-training periods, it was found that in diagnosis of fibromyalgia the TCIRC had a greater development than the TA when pre- and post-test evolution were compared. In 6 weeks, however, the TA had better results than the TCIRC in aerobic capacity, considering the duration of the training period. In the variable strength development, as expected, the TCIRC showed a higher evolution. Thus, it was concluded that circuit training can be an alternative form of treatment of fibromyalgia.

Methods: A total of 33 resistance- and endurance-trained men were randomly allocated into 3 groups: VL15, VL 45%, and ET. ET was similar across all groups. The CT groups differed in the VL allowed during the RT set. Before and after the 8-week training program the following tests were performed: (1) running sprints, (2) vertical jump, (3) progressive loading test in the squat exercise, and (4) incremental treadmill running test up to maximal oxygen uptake. Results: Significant differences (P <.001) in RT volume (approximately 401 vs 177 total repetitions for VL 45% and VL15, respectively) were observed. Significant ""group"" × ""time"" interactions were observed for vertical jump and all strength-related variables: the CT groups attained significantly greater gains than ET. Moreover, a significant ""group"" × ""time"" interaction (P =.03) was noted for velocity at maximal oxygen uptake. Although all groups showed increases in velocity at maximal oxygen uptake, the VL15 group achieved greater gains than the ET group. Conclusions: CT interventions experienced greater strength gains than the ET group. Although all groups improved their endurance performance, the VL15 intervention resulted in greater gains than the ET approach. Therefore, moderate VL thresholds in RT performed during CT could be a good strategy for concurrently maximizing strength and endurance development.

Seventeen 5-week-old male Wistar rats were assigned to a control (n = 5) or training (n = 12) group. Each rat in the training group ran voluntarily in a running-wheel cage for 8 weeks. After the training period, the animals were anesthetized, and the plantaris muscles were removed, weighed, and analyzed immunohistochemically and biochemically. Although there were no significant differences in muscle weight or fiber area between the groups, the numbers of satellite cells and myonuclei per muscle fiber, percentage of satellite cells, and citrate synthase activity were significantly higher in the training group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The percentage of satellite cells was also positively correlated with distance run in the training group (r = 0.61, p < 0.05). Voluntary running can induce an increase in the number of satellite cells without changing the mean fiber area in the rat plantaris muscle; this increase in satellite cell content is a function of distance run.

Methods Thirty-two postmenopausal women (45–60 years) were randomly assigned to water-based endurance training, resistance training, combined (water and resistance) training, or control group ( n = 8 each). Training groups performed endurance (45 min swimming at 40–60% of maximal heart rate (HR max )), resistance (three sets of 10–12 repetitions at 40–60% of one-repetition maximum (1RM)), or combined (swimming plus resistance) training (22 min resistance training, two sets of 10–12 repetitions at 40–60% of 1RM and 22 min endurance training at 40–60% of HR max ) three days per week for 10 weeks. Blood samples were taken before and 48 h after training. Results Endurance and combined training caused significant ( P < 0.05) reductions in body weight (both approx. 2.5 kg), body fatness (0.3% and 0.4%), waist/hip ratio, visfatin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and HOMA-IR, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein level compared to the control group. There were no such significant changes following resistance training. ICAM-1 levels decreased ( P < 0.05) in all training groups compared to the control group. Post-training visfatin concentrations were negatively correlated with body mass index, body weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and HOMA-IR. Conclusion Water-based endurance training and combined (endurance plus resistance) training have a more favorable effect on metabolic markers of cardiovascular disease risk, diabetes risk, and serum visfatin in obese women than resistance training alone.

Twenty-two healthy obese women with a mean weight of 96.9 plus/minus 14 kg and age of 38 plus/minus 7 yr were randomly assigned to diet-alone (D) or diet-plus-exercise training (D plus EX) conditions. Subjects consumed 950 kcal.d-1 using prepackaged portion-controlled foods. Subjects in the D plus EX group participated 3 times.week-1 in a supervised program of light- to moderate-intensity aerobic activity and resistance training. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA. After 8 wk of treatment, body weight decreased significantly in both groups (10.8 percent in D vs 11.4 percent in D plus EX), whereas absolute and relative VO2peak increased in only D plus EX (12.3 percent in D vs 57.7 in D plus EX). Both groups experienced significant decreases in peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes, although cell numbers remained within clinically normal range at week 8. NK cell (CD56 plus) proportion was unchanged in both groups after weight loss. The proportion of peripheral mononuclear cells expressing the interleukin-2 receptor-alpha (IL-2R alpha) (CD25 plus) decreased significantly (25.2 percent) in D and was unchanged in D plus EX, resulting in a significant difference between groups at week 8. NK cell cytotoxicity was suppressed in D and unchanged in D plus EX after treatment. Changes in NK cell activity were significantly correlated with proportional changes in (CD25 plus) r = 0.584, P = 0.022), but not CD56 plus. A combined program of light- to moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise offsets the apparent decrement in NK cell activity associated with weight loss.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-20656&site=ehost-live"

Despite its growing popularity, the specific effects of WBV training on muscle morphology, strength, and endurance are not well understood, particularly in young adults. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of WBV training on bone-free lean body mass (BFLBM), and maximal muscle strength and endurance in healthy, untrained, young individuals. Eighteen healthy men and women (21-39 years) were randomly assigned to either a bodyweight exercise with WBV (VT) group or a control exercise group without WBV (CON). Participants performed eight exercises per 40-min session on a vibration platform (VT group, frequency = 30-40 Hz; amplitude = 2 mm) twice weekly for 12 weeks. Anthropometry, total and regional BFLBM (trunks, legs, and arms) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and muscle strength and endurance measured by maximal isometric lumbar extension strength, maximal isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength, and the number of sit-ups performed were recorded and compared. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no significant changes between the groups in any of the measured variables. We conclude that 12 weeks of body weight vibration exercise compared to body weight exercise alone does not provide meaningful changes to BFLBM or muscle performance in healthy young adults.

Many studies have shown in elderly subjects that an increase in cardiorespiratory function and VO2max can be achieved with endurance training, but the effects of strength conditioning on cardiovascular fitness and aerobic power have not been extensively examined in older subjects. The lack of data concerning the effects of isokinetic training on cardiopulmonary function in elderly subjects has prompted the present study. Eight sedentary men (average 68 +/- 4 years) underwent 13 weeks of isokinetic training, two sessions per week lasting one hour each. One week before and two-three days after the training period each subject performed: A) isokinetic strength test evaluating the knee extensor and flexor muscles; B) incremental exercise on a bicycle ergometer up to voluntary exhaustion. In addition, measurement of quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) was carried out by means of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. At all investigated angular velocities there was, after training, a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase of both extensor and flexor muscles isokinetic strength. After training all investigated subjects showed during exercise B) lower values of heart rate (HR) both at rest and at the same absolute workload. The average value of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2peak) increased from 24.9 to 27.6 ml.min-1.kg-1 (p &lt; 0.01). A linear relationship (p &lt; 0.05) was found between VO2peak and CSA values obtained both before and after training. The results of the present study have shown that, at least in our limited group of sedentary elderly men, isokinetic strength training program besides improve muscle mass and strength may also increase maximal aerobic power. Furthermore this latter resulted close correlated with the quadriceps CSA value, supporting a causal role for peripheral factors in determining VO2peak. From these findings it appears beneficial for elderly population to add to traditional aerobic rehabilitation / training protocols, a series of isokinetic exercises.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-657664&site=ehost-live"

J Strength Cond Res 32(7): 1861–1868, 2018—The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an 8-week concurrent strength and endurance training program in comparison with endurance training only on several key determinants of hand cycling performance. Five H4 and 5 H3 classified hand cyclists with at least 1 year's hand cycling training history consented to participate in the study. Subjects underwent a battery of tests to establish body mass, body composition, V̇ o 2peak, maximum aerobic power, gross mechanical efficiency (GME), maximal upper-body strength, and 30-km time-trial performance. Subjects were matched into pairs based on 30-km time-trial performance and randomly allocated to either a concurrent strength and endurance or endurance training only, intervention group. After an 8-week training program based on a conjugated block periodization model, subjects completed a second battery of tests. A mixed model, 2-way analysis of variance revealed no significant changes between groups. However, the calculation of effect sizes (ESs) revealed that both groups demonstrated a positive improvement in most physiological and performance measures with subjects in the concurrent group demonstrating a greater magnitude of improvement in body composition (ES −0.80 vs. −0.22), maximal aerobic power (ES 0.97 vs. 0.28), GME (ES 0.87 vs. 0.63), bench press 1 repetition maximum (1RM) (ES 0.53 vs. 0.33), seated row 1RM (ES 1.42 vs. 0.43), and 30-km time-trial performance (ES −0.66 vs. −0.30). In comparison with endurance training only, an 8-week concurrent training intervention based on a conjugated block periodization model seems to be a more effective training regime for improving the performance capabilities of hand cyclists.

Methods: Fasting glycemia, insulinemia, and glycated haemoglobin were determined by conventional methods, IR by Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), lean mass by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, muscle activation through carnosine by Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, and musclin by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay before and after a supervised, three-times/week, 12-week treadmill programme. HIIT (n = 29) consisted of six intervals with one-minute, high-intensity phases at 90% of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). MICT (n = 31) trained at 60% of VO2peak for 30 min. Results: Patients had a mean age of 50.8 ± 6.0 years, body mass index of 30.6 ± 4.0 kg/m2, and VO2peak of 29.0 ± 6.3 mL.kg−1.min−1. Compared to MICT, HIIT was not superior at reducing Ln HOMA-IR (adjusted mean difference: 0.083 [95%CI − 0.092 to 0.257]), carnosine or musclin or at increasing thigh lean mass. HIIT increased carnosine by 0.66 mmol/kg.ww (95% CI 0.08–1.24) after intervention. Both interventions reduced IR, body fat percentage and increased total lean mass/height2 and VO2peak. Musclin showed a non-significant reduction with a small effect size after both interventions. Conclusion: Compared to MICT, HIIT is not superior at reducing IR, carnosine or musclin or at increasing skeletal muscle mass in adults with MS. Both training types improved IR, muscle mass and body composition. NCT03087721, March 22nd, 2017. Trial registration number: NCT03087721. Registered March 22nd, 2017.

Design Randomized controlled prospective trial with 2 parallel groups. Setting Amputee unit of a rehabilitation hospital. Participants Subjects with unilateral lower limb amputation (N=51) with phantom limb pain (PLP) and/or phantom limb sensation (PLS). Interventions The experimental group performed combined training of progressive muscle relaxation, mental imagery, and phantom exercises 2 times/wk for 4 weeks, whereas the control group had the same amount of physical therapy dedicated to the residual limb. No pharmacological intervention was initiated during the trial period. Main Outcome Measures The Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire and the Brief Pain Inventory were used to evaluate changes over time in different aspects (intensity, rate, duration, and bother) of PLS and PLP. Blind evaluations were performed before and after treatment and after 1-month follow-up. Results The experimental group showed a significant decrease over time in all the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire domains (in terms of both PLS and PLP; P <.04 for both) and the Brief Pain Inventory ( P <.03). No statistically significant changes were observed in the control group. Between-group analyses showed a significant reduction in intensity (average and worst pain) and bother of PLP and rate and bother of PLS at follow-up evaluation, 1 month after the end of the treatment. Conclusions Combined training of progressive muscle relaxation, mental imagery, and modified phantom exercises should be taken into account as a valuable technique to reduce phantom limb pain and sensation.

Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as biomarkers of type 2 diabetes risk. Here, we investigated if four circulating miRNAs related to glucose metabolism were altered in men with a FH + and we conducted a preliminary analysis to determine if miRNA expressions were responsive to 8 weeks of combined exercise training. Methods: Sixteen young healthy men (mean ± SD; age 22.5 ± 2.5; BMI 26.4 ± 4.0) with FH + or without a family history of type 2 diabetes (FH −) underweight 8 weeks of combined endurance and resistance exercise training (n = 8 FH −; n = 8 FH +). The expression of miR-29a, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-155 were measured in serum before and after exercise training. QIAGEN's Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis was used to examine miRNA target genes and their involvement in glucose metabolism signaling pathways. Results: There were no differences in miRNA expressions between FH − and FH +. Exercise training did not alter miRNA expressions in either FH − or FH + despite improvements in insulin sensitivity, aerobic capacity, and muscular strength. miR-29a and miR-155 were inversely related to fasting glucose, and miR-133a and miR-133b were negatively correlated with glucose tolerance; however, correlations were not observed with insulin sensitivity. Conclusions: The circulating miRNAs- miR-29a, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-155 are related to measures of glucose metabolism in healthy, normoglycemic men, but do not reflect peripheral insulin sensitivity or improvements in metabolic health following 8 weeks of combined exercise training.

There were 20 male subjects who participated in the study; 11 experimental (EX) (22.8±4.6 years) and 9 controls (CON) (23.2±5.8 years). An incremental cycling test was performed to determine maximal oxygen uptake, OBLA, maximum power, and time to exhaustion. Additionally, strength of the leg press (LP), leg curl (LC), and leg extension (LE) was assessed in both groups. Participants continued their ongoing endurance training, whereas the EX group supplemented their training with HVRT twice weekly for 8 weeks, performing 4 sets of 15 repetitions of LP, LC, and LE. Change score (post-pre) analysis was measured, using t-tests to compare the differences between groups, to eliminate outside variables that may have affected testing performance. Significance was set at p # 0.05. No significant group differences in baseline measures were observed. A significant difference was observed for OBLA at 4 mmol·L-1 (EX: 18.17±15.36 W and CON: 23.52±20.13 W, p, 0.02). A significant difference was observed for LP (EX: 39.09±25.87 kg and CON: 4.22±34.65 kg, p, 0.02) and LC (EX: 22.84±8.7 kg and CON: 21.47±8.2 kg, p, 0.01). Supplementing HVRT in endurance-trained individuals delayed OBLA at 4 mmol·L-1 and improved leg strength. The HVRT used in the current study may be a useful training style for endurance-trained individuals.

Frailty is an age-associated biological syndrome characterized by decreases in the biological functional reserve and resistance to stressors due to changes in several physiological systems, which puts older individuals at special risk of disability. To counteract the neuromuscular and cardiovascular declines associated with aging, as well as to prevent and treat the frailty syndrome, the strength and endurance training seems to be an effective strategy to improve muscle hypertrophy, strength and power output, as well as endurance performance. The combination of strength and endurance training (i.e., concurrent training) performed at moderate volume and moderate to high intensity in elderly populations is the most effective way to improve both neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory functions. Moreover, exercise interventions that include muscle power training should be prescribed to frail elderly in order to improve the overall physical status of this population and prevent disability. A multi-component exercise intervention program that consists of strength, endurance, and balance training appears to be the best strategy for improving gait, balance, and strength, as well as reducing the rate of falls in elderly individuals and consequently maintaining their functional capacity during aging. Most of the studies demonstrating improvements in gait, balance, and fall risk have used multicomponent exercise training as intervention in their subjects.

Electrocardiography (ECG) was used in examinations as an efficient method for detecting and assessing circulatory changes and discerning those adaptive from the pathologic ones. The ECG monitoring was prior to a laboratory exercise simulating the 2000-m distance run on a rowing ergometer and carried out on 153 junior rowers (101 boys and 52 girls). The subjects with any disorder found in them (deviation from the normal electrocardiogram at rest) performed the rowing test on the ergometer (as far as such effort was not inadvisable for anyone) Next, they were reexamined in fifth minute following the test trial. The most frequently encountered disorders in the examined subjects were: sinusoidal bradycardia (BC), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and disorders of intraventricular conduction (ICD). The ECG records reflected to a high degree the effects of a strength-endurance training. This type of exercise induces some adaptive changes resulting in a more efficient heart function (""athletic heart""). The ""athletic heart"" may thus exhibit several coexisting cardiocirculatory disorders, especially in more advanced athletes. In this study, the observed abnormalities in young rowers were much more frequent in boys than in girls. Moreover, a tendency to disorder dependence on training practice was found out only in boys.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH347161&site=ehost-live"

We used a sample of 12 subjects, subsequently split into to different groups of 6. All subjects were participants in a four week, four times per week, 50 minute cycling training protocol. One group was also subjected to a simultaneous electrical muscle stimulation protocol on three of the training sessions. To assess maximal aerobic power output we used a maximal cycle-ergometer test with step by step load increases. Our results demonstrated that the muscle stimulation assisted group revealed a statistically significant Vo2máx increase, as well as a higher physical fitness development when comparing within group heart rate evolution. However, between group difference was not significant. We may thus conclude that combined training methodologies may contribute to a faster and more effective goal achievement when regarding VO2máx variables.

Method: The pre-season preparation period trainings, which were designed as a combined training, were applied to the subject group 6 days a week, and 8-10 times a day (120 mins/day) for 8 weeks, during the pre-season preparation period. As per the control group, they attended the pre-season preparation period trainings, which were designed as a classical training, for 4 days a week and 6 times a day (12 mins/day). The statistical results were calculated through the IBM statistics data editor package program. Results: When the results of the research were evaluated, it was determined that there was statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test values of the group using the combined training method for the 30 meter speed test, cooper test, and right hand grasping power values; When the heart rate variable of the study was examined, it was determined that there was statistical significance in the maximum heart rate and anaerobic threshold values of the group using the classical training method. As per the group using the combined training method, there was statistical significance in the aerobic threshold capacity values. Although there were differences for the body composition measurements and elasticity values, there was statistically no significance. Conclusion: As the conclusion, when the findings of the study are examined, it is thought that starting with the classical training method and choosing the combined training method towards the end of the preparatory season will be more beneficial for the development of athletes.

Eleven world-class level paddlers underwent a battery of tests and were assessed four times during the training cycle (T0, T1, T2, and T3). On each occasion subjects completed an incremental test to exhaustion on the kayak-ergometer to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), second ventilatory threshold (VT2), peak blood lactate, paddling speed at VO(2max) (PS(max)) and at VT2 (PS(VT2)), stroke rate at VO(2max) and at VT2, heart rate at VO(2max) and at VT2. One-repetition maximum (1RM) and mean velocity with 45% 1RM load (V (45%)) were assessed in the bench press (BP) and prone bench pull (PBP) exercises. Anthropometric measurements (skinfold thicknesses and muscle girths) were also obtained. Training volume and exercise intensity were quantified for each of three training phases (P1, P2, and P3). Significant improvements in VO(2max) (9.5%), VO(2) at VT2 (9.4%), PS(max) (6.2%), PS(VT2) (4.4%), 1RM in BP (4.2%) and PBP (5.3%), V (45%) in BP (14.4%) and PBP (10.0%) were observed from T0 to T3. A 12-week periodized strength and endurance program with special emphasis on prioritizing the sequential development of specific physical fitness components in each training phase (i.e. muscle hypertrophy and VT2 in P1, and maximal strength and aerobic power in P2) seems effective for improving both cardiovascular and neuromuscular markers of highly trained top-level athletes.

Thirty-eight females (aged 18-24 years) were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) E, (2) ER or (3) active control (AC). The E and ER groups completed 15 weeks of marathon training. The ER group performed additional resistance training and the AC group maintained their usual exercise routine. Primary outcomes were measured pre- and post-training and included anthropometric indices, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, plasma CRP, time to complete 1.5 miles (in minutes), and upper and lower body strength tests (i.e., 8 repetition max on bench and leg press (ER group only)). There were no differences in any variable among the groups at baseline. After training, the E group decreased time to complete 1.5 miles ( p < 0.05). The AC group decreased percent and absolute body fat while the E group decreased percent body fat, absolute body fat, and android and gynoid body fat ( p < 0.05). The ER group significantly improved strength ( p < 0.001) and reduced plasma CRP from 2.0 ± 1.1 to 0.8 ± 0.3 mg·L-1 ( p = 0.03). No significant associations were observed between CRP and measures of body composition or aerobic capacity. Combined endurance and resistance training may be an effective modality for reducing plasma CRP in young adult females independent of changes in aerobic capacity or body composition.

Methods: Fourteen triathletes were assigned to an endurance-strength training group and an endurance-only training group. They performed three experimental trials before and after training: an incremental cycling test to exhaustion, a maximal concentric lower-limbs strength measurement and a 2-h cycling exercise. Physiological parameters, free cycling chosen cadence and the EMG of Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Rectus Femoris (RF) were analysed during the 2-h cycling task before and after a strength training programme of 5weeks (three times per week). Results: The results showed that the maximum strength and the isometric maximal voluntary contraction (isoMVC) after training were significantly higher (P <0.01) and lower (P <0.01) than those before training, respectively, in endurance-strength training group and endurance-only group. The physiological variables measured during the cycling tests and the progressive increase (P <0.01) in EMGi(VL) and EMGi(RF) throughout the 2-h cycling test did not differ between the two groups before and after training, except for the variation of EMGi(VL) over the cycle time which was stabilized during the second hour of the 2-h cycling test due to training in endurance-strength training group. The decrease in free cycling chosen cadence observed in pre-training (P <0.01) was also replaced by a steady free cycling chosen cadence for the endurance-strength training group during the second hour of exercise. Conclusion: This study confirmed the decrease in the free cycling chosen cadence with exercise duration and demonstrated that a specific combined endurance and strength training can prevent this decrease during a 2-h constant cycling exercise.

Peak work level (watts), oxygen consumption (VO2 mL/min;mL/kg.min), and ventilation (VE,L/min) were determined on a bicycle ergometer (BE), a Schwinn Air-Dyne ergometer (SAE), and an arm crank ergometer (ACE) before and after exercise training. Isokinetic leg strength measured using a dynamometer and total work capacity in watts using BE were also determined before and after training. The subject trained for 16 weeks at an approximate frequency of 3 days/week, an average duration of 30 minutes, and an average intensity of 75 percent to 80 percent of pretraining peak HR. A 9 percent and 11 percent improvement was seen in peak oxygen consumption for the SAE and BE, respectively. For peak ventilation, a 23 percent and 11 percent improvement was seen for the SAE and BE, respectively. For the ACE, a 16 percent increase in peak ventilation was seen, with no improvement in aerobic capacity. Total work capacity on the BE was improved by 29 percent following training. Positive improvements were also seen in isokinetic leg strength. This study demonstrated that a man still suffering residual symptoms following an incidence of GBS was able to improve his cardiopulmonary and work capacity and isokinetic strength of his legs following a supervised training program using the SAE.

Much of the research attributes this decrease in peak force to age-associated reductions in muscle mass, with a selective atrophy and reduction in Type II fiber area and number being the primary factors. The influence that chronic endurance training has upon age-associated changes in muscular strength and muscle morphology has been largely undetermined. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the influence of chronic endurance training and age on leg extensor strength, and muscle fiber size and type distribution. Methods: Male master runners (N = 107, age range = 40-88 yr) were tested for maximal strength of the leg extensor muscles. A subgroup of 30 master athletes participated in muscle biopsy testing. The effects of age were addressed by subdividing the sample into five cohorts. Results: Peak isokinetic concentric torque did not differ between age groups until after age 70 yr. Regression analysis revealed a significant (P &lt; 0.05, r2 = 0.1838) age-associated decrease in relative strength (N.m.kg-1 lean body mass).

Preexercise and postexercise testing was performed with muscle strength evaluations using isokinetic testing as well as hand-held Myometer. Muscle fatigue was determined by use of isokinetic testing, and endurance was determined by exercise testing. Enzymatic evaluation was performed with muscle biopsies taken at the same site; preexercise and postexercise muscle cross-sectional area was measured by computed tomography. Disability and psychosocial evaluation was performed by a Functional Status Questionnaire. Seventeen postpolio subjects ranging in age from 39 to 49 years volunteered for a 6-month combined endurance and strength training program. They had a history of acute poliomyelitis at least 25 years earlier and were able to walk with or without aid. Twelve of the subjects (mean age 42 years) completed the program, attending an average of 29 sessions, which were offered for 60 minutes twice a week. Strength, endurance, enzymatic activity, and cross-sectional area were measured 3 months before the beginning of training, just before training, and at the completion of the exercise program. Knee extension was reduced to an average of 60 percent of control values and did not change with training. Strength measured with a hand-held Myometer increased significantly for elbow flexion, wrist extension, and hip abduction. Exercise test on a bicycle-ergometer showed significant reduction (6 beats/min) in heart rate at 70W and increase (12 beats/min) in maximal heart rate with training. The training program could be performed without major complications and resulted in an increase in muscle strength in some muscle groups and in work performance with respect to heart rate at submaximal work load.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH403574&site=ehost-live"

We investigated the impact of superimposed endurance training in younger (28.5 ± 4.8 years; n = 8) and older (67.5 ± 5.5 years; n = 7) highly resistance-trained men. Participants underwent a 10-week endurance cycling training programme consisting of five 6-min intervals at 75% max heart rate (HRmax) separated by 4-min intervals at 90% HRmax. The anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA) of the thigh muscles, as determined with MRI, was 24% smaller in older compared to younger participants (p < 0.001). Although maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) was also lower in the older group (p < 0.001), VO2max per kg body mass did not differ significantly between younger and older participants. Histological analyses of biopsies of the m. vastus lateralis showed that endurance training induced an increase in succinate dehydrogenase activity in both younger and older participants (p ≤ 0.043), and an increase in the number of capillaries around type I fibres (p = 0.017). The superimposed endurance training did not induce a significant decrease in thigh ACSA, fibre cross-sectional area, or knee extensor maximum voluntary isometric force. These observations indicate that adding endurance training to resistance training can lead to positive endurance-related adaptations without negative consequences for muscle size and strength in older and younger resistance-trained people.

The aim of this study was to identify, through literature, whether the combination of exercises of the ST with exercises of the AT allows changes in body composition and energy expenditure during and after the training session. Chronic studies have showed a positive effect on body composition (decreased in relative body fat) when the ST are combined with AT. Similarly, the acute effects of the order of combining these two types of exercise does not seem to affect energy expenditure, measured by oxygen consumption (VO2), during the training session and only change this expenditure in the first 15 minutes after the training session. In conclusion, we can say that the studies indicate that the combination of exercises of the ST with exercises of the AT has a positive effect on changes in body composition, and energy expenditure during and after training sessions.

Methods A group of 23 stable CHF patients included consecutively followed an exercise training programme, 3 days a week for 8 weeks. The first group (P1 , n = 11) exercised on a cycloergometer for 45 min at 65% of peak . The second group (P2 , n = 12) followed a 45-min combined bicycle and quadricipital strength training. Strength training consisted of 10 series of 10 repetitions at 70% of maximal voluntary force. Incremental maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests as well as an isokinetic quadricipital dynamometry evaluation were performed before and after training. Results and conclusions In P1, peak increased by 20% (22·3 ± 4·9 versus 17·8 ± 4·5 ml min−1 kg−1; P<0·05) without any significant change in isokinetic muscle strength. In P2, peak improved within the same range (20·5 ± 2·8 versus 18·6 ± 3·7 ml min−1 kg−1; P<0·01). This last rehabilitation programme significantly increased isokinetic muscle strength at each angular velocities (+10·5 ± 13·5%, P<0·04; +5·6 ± 7·0%, P<0·03; for 180° s−1 and 60° s−1 respectively).

Design: Sixty physical education students were randomly assigned to five experimental groups: all types of training (A), full-squat (B), parallel-squat (C), loaded countermovement jumping (D) and plyometric training (E). Participants in each group trained three days a week for a total of seven weeks. Methods: Sprint performance (30m), maximal dynamic strength (1RM) (kg) and velocity of displacement in the concentric phase of full-squat (m/s) were measured before and after seven weeks of training. Results: Pre-training results showed no significant differences among the groups in any of the variables tested. After seven weeks no significant improvement in sprint performance was found, however, significant improvement in maximal dynamic strength, velocity of displacement were observed in all the groups: combined methods group A (20%), heavy-resistance group B (11%), power-oriented group C (17%), ballistic group D (14%) and plyometric group E (6%). Conclusions: A combined training approach using full-squat, parallel-squat, loaded countermovement jumping and plyometric training results in a light improvement in maximal strength, velocity of displacement and sprint performance and the resemblance between movement patterns and the velocity of displacement common to the training and testing methods also contributes to greater performance improvement.

This study examines the effects of combined strength and jump exercises training on the vertical jump performance, in a group of senior elite male volleyball players during a full competition season. Twelve professional male volleyball players took part in this study. Players competed in the first national division of the Spanish National League during the 2014-2015 season. The performance was estimated by unloaded (CMJ), loaded countermovement jumps (CMJloaded) height (cm) and by velocity of displacement in the concentric phase of full squat (FS) (ms-1). Training took place 2 days/week, 16 weeks (2 cycles/8 weeks, 1 week recovery). The resistance exercises were: FS, 3-4 series/4-6 repetitions, load from 50%-65% 1RM; hang power clean, 3 series/4-6 repetitions with the maximum load that allows a correct technical execution; loaded jump, 3-4 series/4-5 repetitions, load from 50%-80% according to the weight with which the athletes reached a height of about 20 cm.; unloaded jump, 3-4 series/5 repetitions. There was a significant increase in CMJ and CMJloaded (7.12% and 9.78%; p<.01; respectively). No significant changes were observed in FS (1.66%; p>.05). Our results suggest that the use of moderate loads could produce similar results on vertical jump performance to the use of high loads, since in our study a load equivalent to 65% 1RM in the FS was not exceeded and jumping exercises were performed with light loads. These results indicate that the specificity of training, which in this case is expressed by the proximity of the velocities of execution of the training exercises to the velocity of execution of the vertical jump, is determinant for the performance.

Method. Twelve sedentary volunteers (51,50 ± 6,52 years old) were submitted to a CT during 30 weeks, three times per week. Before and after the CT, were analyzed anthropometric, functional and biochemical variables. It was performed a two-dimensional ultrasound for carotid IMT and the quantification and com-parison of carotid IMT of participants was named VA. The difference between VAand chronological age was named age's delta and the Framingham risk score was calculated. Furthermore, it was calculated the modi-fied Framingham risk score (MFS), replacing chronological age for VA. Results: The carotid IMT, the VA, the age's delta and the Framingham score did not decrease significantly after 30 weeks of CT. However, the scoring in MFS decreased after the intervention (p < 0.05). Besides, the CT increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p < 0.05) and the estimated maximal oxygen uptake (p < 0.01 ) in individuals with MS. Conclusion: The proposed concurrent training did not alter the carotid IMT and the VA, although had de-creased the MFS scoring, which can identify individuals previously not recognize such with a high risk and assist in the individual therapy of patients with MS.

Results and Discussion: The results showed the need to control the combination of different intensities when training both capacities, the frequency of the sessions, and the order and minimum recuperation that must exist when two sessions of both capacities are scheduled on the same day. Conclusions: The study revealed that when combining different intensities with the objective of avoiding the interference phenomenon, the intensities used should not be those that could produce peripheral adaptations, and that an 8-hour interval must be left in case of having two sessions on the same day. Furthermore, it became clear that players with more strength and power might have a head start in the game actions due to the strength requirements of the sport.

Despite multiple health and exercise performance-related benefits, diminished muscle hypertrophy, strength and power have been reported with concurrent training compared to resistance training in isolation. Dietary protein is well-established to facilitate skeletal muscle growth, repair and regeneration during recovery from exercise. The degree to which increased protein intake can amplify adaptation responses with resistance exercise, and to a lesser extent aerobic exercise, has been highly studied. In contrast, much less focus has been directed toward the capacity for protein to enhance anabolic and metabolic responses with divergent contractile stimuli inherent to concurrent training and potentially negate interference in muscle strength, power and hypertrophy. This review consolidates available literature investigating increased protein intake on rates of muscle protein synthesis, hypertrophy, strength and force/power adaptations following acute and chronic concurrent training. Acute concurrent exercise studies provide evidence for the significant stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis with protein compared to placebo ingestion. High protein intake can also augment increases in lean mass with chronic concurrent training, although these increases do not appear to translate into further improvements in strength adaptations. Similarly, the available evidence indicates protein intake twice the recommended intake and beyond does not rescue decrements in selective aspects of muscle force and power production with concurrent training.

Chromium picolinate and l-carnitine are two nutrient complexes which have received significant attention for their theorized ability to promote anabolism and improve cardiovascular endurance, respectively. Chromium picolinate and l-carnitine formulations are currently being marketed as agents capable of enhancing body composition and performance, despite the absence of research investigating their safety and efficacy. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of METABOTRIM, a nutrient formulation containing both chromium picolinate and l-carnitine, to determine whether it had any impact on body composition, strength or maximal oxygen uptake in training female athletes compared to a placebo treatment. Twelve female collegiate athletes participated in the study. Subjects completed informed consent forms prior to participation. Before, and immediately following an eight week supplementation and training program, subjects underwent extensive testing. Body composition evaluations included 7-site skinfold measurement, 9-site circumference measurement, hydrostatic weighing and body mass. Muscular strength was measured using one repetition maximum (1-RM) strength tests for bench press, leg extension and leg flexion. Graded treadmill exercise tests were used to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Subjects were pair-matched on initial body fat levels and were randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to either the supplement or placebo group. For eight weeks all subjects participated in an off-season training program involving weight lifting three days per week and endurance training three days per week. The weight lifting program had a strength-building emphasis and the principle of progressive overload was employed. Endurance training involved two mile runs and various combinations of short and long sprints. Separate repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that there were no significant changes in any of the body composition measures during the study. Both groups improved significantly in strength as a result of training. Significant main effects for time were found for bench press, leg extension and sum of strength. No interactions were observed for any of the strength variables. No significant changes in VO2max occurred in either group. The present study did not control for dietary intake. Baseline nutrient status and urinary excretion levels of the supplemented nutrients were not measured. In addition, the small sample size reduced statistical power. Length of the training and supplementation period may also have been insufficient. The results of the present study suggest that METABOTRIM was ineffective in eliciting changes in body composition, strength or endurance over an eight-week period in training female athletes.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH411022&site=ehost-live"

Both CST and RT resulted in significant improvements (p ≤ 0.05) in the 1 -RM back squat (37.5 ± 7.8; 40.0 ± 9.6 kg), maximal isometric force (55.7 ± 51.3; 53.7 ± 36.7 kg), average peak anaerobic power testing (7.4 ± 6.2; 7.6 ± 6.4%), and zero-incline treadmill velocity, resulting in maximal oxygen consumption (1.8 ± 0.6; 0.8 ± 0.6 km$h21). Only zero-incline treadmill velocity demonstrated a group-by-time interaction with a greater improvement after CST (p < 0.01). Rate of force development was not altered in either group. Results provide no evidence of interference to the adaptive process by CST. Coaches desiring improvements in strength, power, and endurance may want to evaluate how spring and high-intensity interval training might supplement programs already in place.

It is inferred that cardiologists were concerned with recommending exercise to their patients with CHF because of the notion that habitual exercise training could accelerate the disease process through cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. However, clinical trials have shown that exercise training among CHF patients improves cardiac vagal influence, which may protect the heart during acute exercise from arrhythmias. Furthermore, a combination of moderate-intensity aerobic and strength training programs for CHF patients enhances aerobic capacity, skeletal muscle structure, and peripheral blood flow. The author advised that patients with CHF should undergo medical assessment before exercising.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=25741035&site=ehost-live"

Multiple review articles have suggested guidelines for the most efficacious training methods to obtain muscular hypertrophy. Unfortunately these included articles that inferred hypertrophy markers such as hormonal measurements, used older techniques that might not be valid (e.g. circumference) and failed to appropriately consider the complexity of training variables. Methods: The present commentary provides a narrative review of literature, summarising main areas of interest and providing evidence-based guidelines towards training for muscular hypertrophy. Conclusions: Evidence supports that persons should train to the highest intensity of effort, thus recruiting as many motor units and muscle fibres as possible, self-selecting a load and repetition range, and performing single sets for each exercise. No specific resistance type appears more advantageous than another, and persons should consider the inclusion of concentric, eccentric and isometric actions within their training regime, at a repetition duration that maintains muscular tension. Between set/exercise rest intervals appear not to affect hypertrophy, and in addition the evidence suggests that training through a limited range of motion might stimulate similar results to full range of motion exercise. The performance of concurrent endurance training appears not to negatively affect hypertrophy, and persons should be advised not to expect uniform muscle growth both along the belly of a muscle or for individual muscles within a group. Finally evidence suggests that short (~3 weeks) periods of detraining in trained persons does not incur significant muscular atrophy and might stimulate greater hypertrophy upon return to training.

The tests included maximum oxygen uptake, heart rate and blood lactate, bench push and bench pull for maximum strength (1RM), endurance strength (40%lRM for 120 seconds) and 300m race in flat water. Descriptive statistics were calculated and analyzed using SPSS 25.0 in order to analyze the physical fitness of the Chinese excellent slalom kayakers and proposed corresponding training protocol. The results showed that the aerobic capacity, specific strength, basic and special rowing speed of the Chinese elite players statistically fell behind of those of the world top kayakers. In order to be competitive at the world top level race, the percentage of aerobic training for elite canoe slalom athletes throughout the year should be increased. A combination of water and land aerobic training should be adopted to enrich the methods and means of aerobic training, and arrange their load and intensity reasonably. In addition, basic strength training should be used to develop the athlete's upper limb explosive force, strength endurance and trunk stability strength. Water strength training should be combined to enhance the peak force and power of athletes' paddling. Both the basic speed of rowing in flat water, high intensity and high speed full run racing ability should be emphasized.

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the variation of bone mineral density (BMD), generated by physical exercise, in the various areas of compression, both in the lumbar vertebrae and in the different regions of the femur, in an elderly woman submitted to concurrent training. Methods: The present study, characterized as a case study, presents a methodological design of the longitudinal type. The investigated individual was an elderly patient, diagnosed with osteopenia in the L1, L2 and trochanter vertebrae of the femur, and with osteoporosis in the femoral neck, which was followed from 63 to 70 years of age. The patient was submitted to a concurrent training, with aerobic and force components, with load increments, in the same training session. We then analyzed the BMD exams performed in the years 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013. Results and discussion: Important increases in BMD were identified, with a range between 4.8% and 17.7% for lumbar vertebrae L1 and L4, respectively; on the other hand, for the right femur, the increase in BMD was around 10.5% at the femoral neck and 9.2% at the greater trochanter. Conclusion: In the case of osteoporotic patients, strength and aerobic training should be combined to promote resistance and impact.

Studies have demonstrated increases in bone formation in animals and increases in bone mineral density in humans. Studies of animals show that bone has enhanced physical and mechanical properties following periods of increased stress. Strains which are high in rate and magnitude, and of abnormal distribution, but not necessarily long in duration, are best for inducing new bone formation, resulting in the strengthening of bone by increased density. Cross-sectional studies show that athletes, especially those who are strength-trained, have greater bone mineral densities than nonathletes, and that strength, muscle mass and maximal oxygen uptake correlate with bone density. Longitudinal training studies indicate that strength training and high impact endurance training increase bone density. Strain induction, the deformation that occurs in bone under loading, may cause a greater level of formation and an inhibition of resorption within the normal remodelling cycle of bone, or it may cause direct activation of osteoblastic bone formation from the quiescent state. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the transformation of mechanical strain into biochemical stimuli to enhance bone formation. These include prostaglandin release, piezoelectric and streaming potentials, increased bone blood flow, microdamage and hormonally mediated mechanisms. These mechanisms may act on their own or in concert, depending on the loading situation and the characteristics of the bone.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH372429&site=ehost-live"

Aerobic exercise interventions have been shown to increase maximal oxygen consumption in selected patients. In addition, preliminary evidence, although mixed, suggests that aerobic exercise training can improve blood pressure control, lipid profiles and mental health in this population. A few larger studies are now available showing that aerobic training can also improve physical functioning and performance. The impact on survival or hospitalisation has not been determined. Resistance exercise training, although less studied, appears to increase muscle strength and size and may also improve functioning. There have been several reports of successful combined exercise interventions, but the designs have not allowed evaluation of the relative benefits of aerobic and resistance training on physical functioning. Despite the evidence that exercise is safe and beneficial in patients with CKD, dialysis patients remain inactive, and exercise assessment, counselling and training is not widely offered to patients with CKD. Studies of the barriers to patient participation in exercise and to provider assessment and recommendations are needed so that more widely generalisable interventions can be developed. However, in the interim, patients should be encouraged to participate in moderate physical activity to meet the US Surgeon General’s recommendations. Patients who are weak can benefit from strength-training interventions. Resistance and aerobic exercise programmes should be initiated at relatively low intensity in patients with CKD and progressed as slowly as tolerated in order to avoid injury and discontinuation of exercise. For patients on haemodialysis, incorporation of exercise into the dialysis session may increase patient participation and tolerance of exercise.

Activation was determined by the presence of CD4+CD69+ T-helper lymphocytes, mitogen-induced proliferation, and levels of cytokines produced by mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes and in the patients' plasma. Methods: Patients with breast cancer (N = 28) who participated in a 6-month exercise program were compared with patients (N = 21) who did not exercise. Following chemotherapy, and 3 and 6 months later, patients underwent fitness evaluations and had blood drawn. The exercise program consisted of resistance training and aerobic activity at 60-75 % functional capacity three times a week with a personal trainer. Immunochemistry and flow cytometry were used to measure the number of CD4+CD69+ blood lymphocytes. Whole blood was stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA), phytohemagglutin (PHA), or pokeweed mitogen (PWM) to determine proliferation potential. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to determine the concentration of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the culture medium of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes as well as the plasma concentrations of IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor, soluble gp130, and IFN-gamma. Analysis of groups across time was done using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and comparisons of groups were done using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The exercising patients showed increases in maximal oxygen uptake and upper body strength. This group also showed a greater percentage of CD4+CD69+ cells and a greater level of tritiated thymidine incorporation (DNA synthesis) when stimulated with ConA, PHA, and PWM at the end of the intervention. Plasma and mitogen-stimulated IL-6 and IFN-gamma production were similar in both groups. Conclusion: Exercise may improve immune function by increasing lymphocyte activation in patients with breast cancer following treatment.

As more individuals live longer, it is imperative to determine the extent and mechanisms by which exercise and physical activity can improve health, functional capacity, quality of life, and independence in this population. Aging is a complex process involving many variables (eg, genetics, lifestyle factors, chronic diseases) that interact with one another, greatly influencing the manner in which we age. Participation in regular physical activity (both aerobic and strength exercises) elicits a number of favorable responses that contribute to healthy aging. Much has been learned recently regarding the adaptability of various biological systems, as well as the ways that regular exercise can influence them. Participation in a regular exercise program is an effective intervention/modality to reduce/prevent a number of functional declines associated with aging. Further, the trainability of older individuals (including octo- and nonagenarians) is evidenced by their ability to adapt and respond to both endurance and strength training. Endurance training can help maintain and improve various aspects of cardiovascular function (as measured by maximal VO2, cardiac output, and arteriovenous O2 difference), as well as enhance submaximal performance. Importantly, reductions in risk factors associated with disease states (heart disease, diabetes, etc) improve health status and contribute to an increase in life expectancy. Strength training helps offset the loss in muscle mass and strength typically associated with normal aging. Additional benefits from regular exercise include improved bone health and, thus, reduction in risk for osteoporosis; improved postural stability, thereby reducing the risk of falling and associated injuries and fractures; and increased flexibility and range of motion. While not as abundant, the evidence also suggests that involvement in regular exercise can also provide a number of psychological benefits related to preserved cognitive function, alleviation of depression symptoms and behavior, and an improved concept of personal control and self-efficacy. It is important to note that while participation in physical activity may not always elicit increases in the traditional markers of physiological performance and fitness (eg, VO2max, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, body composition) in older adults, it does improve health (reduction in disease risk factors) and functional capacity. Thus, the benefits associated with regular exercise and physical activity contribute to a more healthy, independent lifestyle, greatly improving the functional capacity and quality of life in this population.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-79303&site=ehost-live"

With chronic progressive or relapsing-remitting disease onsets, persons with MS (pwMS) progressively develop impaired functional capacity and show reduced physical activity compared to healthy controls. The role of rehabilitation with exercise as a central component has become an important aspect in the process of reactivating pwMS. The primary aims of rehabilitation are therefore to increase levels of activity and participation leading to increased independence of the participants. Methods: Compared to other training modalities, endurance training is well studied and has become an efficient strategy in rehabilitation of pwMS, improving fatigue and health-related quality of life. The most common form is usage of a cycle ergometer but aquatic-exercise and yoga have also been studied. The main goal of resistance training is the general improvement of force components using different resistors. An individual-suited resistance training program impacts maximal force, core-stability, arm, leg and trunk muscles of pwMS. Discussion: Physical activity impacts various growth factors in the central nervous system, primarily via the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the Insulin Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) and the Vascular Endothel Growth Factor (VEGF). The congnition-promoting effect is achieved via improvement of the metabolic situation in brain tissue, contributing to an increase in brain volume around the Hippocampus. The outstanding cellular adaptation of the BDNF concentrations can be influenced to various degrees by variations in the training protocol. Conclusion: : Rehabilitation with exercise is a central component in the process of reactivating pwMS . Evidence shows that exercise training in pwMS has the potential to target and improve many components outlined in the ICF model. The reviewed effects of exercise for pwMS have demonstrated improvements in aerobic and functional capacities, fatigue and muscle weakness.

Unfortunately, too often physical activity is an underutilized therapy. Favorable changes in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity usually deteriorate within 72 h of the last exercise session; consequently, regular physical activity is imperative to sustain glucose-lowering effects and improved insulin sensitivity. Individuals with type 2 diabetes should strive to achieve a minimum cumulative total of 1000 kcal.wk-1 from physical activities. Those with type 2 diabetes generally have a lower level of fitness (VO2max) than nondiabetic individuals, and therefore exercise intensity should be at a comfortable level (RPE 10-12) in the initial periods of training and should progress cautiously as tolerance for activity improves. Resistance training has the potential to improve muscle strength and endurance, enhance flexibility and body composition, decrease risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and result in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Modifications to exercise type and/or intensity may be necessary for those who have complications of diabetes. Individuals with type 2 diabetes may develop automatic neuropathy, which affects the heart rate response to exercise, and as a result, ratings of perceived exertion rather than heart rate may need to be used for moderating intensity of physical activity. Although walking may be the most convenient low-impact mode, some persons, because of peripheral neuropathy and/or foot problems, may need to do non-weight-bearing activities. Outcome expectations may contribute significantly to motivation to begin and maintain an exercise program. Interventions designed to encourage adoption of an exercise regimen must be responsive to the individual's current stage of readiness and focus efforts on moving the individual through the various 'stages of change'.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-657347&site=ehost-live"

In addition, a majority of these patients have multiple comorbid disorders such as renal, neurologic, and retinal disease that may affect their ability to exercise safely.

However, with dramatic improvements in organ preservation, surgery and immunosuppressive drug management, short term survival is no longer the pivotal issue for most heart transplant recipients (HTR). Rather, a return to functional lifestyle with good quality of life is now the desired procedural outcome. To achieve this outcome, aggressive exercise rehabilitation is essential. HTR present unique exercise challenges. Preoperatively, most of these patients had chronic debilitating cardiac illness. Many HTR have had prolonged pretransplantation hospitalisation for inotropic support or a ventricular assist device. Decrements in peak oxygen consumption (O) and related cardiovascular parameters regress approximately 26% within the first 1 to 3 weeks of sustained bed rest. Consequently, extremely poor aerobic capacity and cardiac cachexia are not unusual occurrences in HTR who have required mechanical support or been confined to bed rest. Moreover, HTR must also contend with de novo exercise challenges conferred by chronic cardiac denervation and the multiple sequelae resulting from immunosuppression therapy. There is ample evidence that both endurance and resistance training are well tolerated in HTR. Moreover, there is growing clinical consensus that specific endurance and resistance training regimens in HTR can be efficacious adjunctive therapies in the prevention of immunosuppression-induced adverse effects and the reversal of pathophysiological consequences associated with cardiac denervation and antecedent heart failure. For example, some HTR who remain compliant during strenuous long term endurance training programmes achieve peak heart rate and O values late after transplantation that approach age-matched norms (up to approximately 95% of predicted). These benefits are not seen in HTR who do not participate in structured endurance exercise training. Rather, peak heart rate and V dotO values in untrained HTR remain approximately 60 to 70% of predicted indefinitely. However, the mechanisms responsible for improved peak heart rate, O and total exercise time are not completely understood and require further investigation. Recent studies have also demonstrated that resistance exercise training may be an effective countermeasure for corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis and skeletal muscle myopathy. HTR who participate in specific resistance training programmes successfully restore bone mineral density (BMD) in both the axial and appendicular skeleton to pretransplantation levels, increase lean mass to levels greater than pretransplantation, and reduce body fat. In contrast, HTR who do not participate in resistance training lose approximately 15% BMD from the lumbar spine early in the postoperative period and experience further gradual reductions in BMD and muscle mass late after transplantation.

The first two of them have a significant impact on muscle phenotype and metabolism while patterned movement exercises concern changes in a motor program in the central nervous system and result in only slight changes in muscle tissue. Adaptation to endurance versus resistance training in most aspects is extremely different. Due to the mutually opposite nature, in classical training systems, endurance and resistance exercises are very often separated. Nowadays, in sport as well as recreation and rehabilitation it is postulated to combine both types of exercises. Because of this, the very important question arises as to how combined workouts including strength and endurance exercises will affect the body. An even more important question concerns the proportions of both types of exercises, their intensity and duration. Therefore, defining safe and effective training systems can be beneficial not only for athletes but also for the prevention of civilization-related diseases and aging effect.

Because these markers have been implicated in cell signaling, they may be specifically related to the training adaptations induced by high-intensity exercise. Thus, a clear model showing their responses to exercise may be useful in characterizing the relative recovery status of an athlete. The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to investigate the time course of markers of muscle damage and inflammation in the blood from 3 to 72 hours after combined training exercises and (b) to investigate indicators of oxidative stress and damage associated with increased reactive oxygen species production during high-intensity exercise in elite athletes. Nineteen male athletes performed a combination of high-intensity aerobic and anaerobic training exercises. Samples were acquired immediately before and at 3, 6,1 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours after exercise. The appearance and clearance of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in the blood occurred faster than previous studies have reported. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio summarizes the mobilization of 2 leukocyte subpopulations in a single marker and may be used to predict the end of the postexercise recovery period. Further analysis of the immune response using serum cytokines indicated that high-intensity exercise performed by highly trained athletes only generated inflammation that was localized to the skeletal muscle. Biomarkers are not a replacement for performance tests, but when used in conjunction, they may offer a better indication of metabolic recovery status. Therefore, the use of biomarkers can improve a coach's ability to assess the recovery period after an exercise session and to establish the intensity of subsequent training sessions.

Twelve older adults with hypertension (8 women) were recruited. Using a within-subject design, participants performed a treadmill GXT to exhaustion followed by a multistage VER both before and after a 12-wkcombined exercise training programme. Individual VO2max, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), maximal heart rate (HRmax), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during both GXT and VER tests. Absolute and relative VO2max values were higher in VER than in GXT at baseline, but only absolute VO2max differed between bouts post-intervention (all p < 0.05). Individual VO2max comparisons revealed that 75% of the participants (9/12) achieved a VO2max value that was ≥3% during VER both before (range: +4.9% to +21%) and after the intervention (range: +3.4% to +18.8%), whereas 91.7% (11/12) of the tests would have been validated as a maximal effort if the classic criteria were employed.

Methods: A middle-age female patient with smoldering multiple myeloma and former elite athlete was monitored for 4 yr while participating in a supervised multimodal training regimen designed for the development of various physical capacities. The patient had the possibility of self-selection of daily training volume. Changes in fitness components, IgG levels, and BMPCs were evaluated throughout a 4-yr monitoring period (i.e., follow-up). HRV was examined via 24-h HR recordings during a 6-wk period at the second and the third year of the follow-up. Results: Exercise performance in all fitness components was improved while IgG levels and BMPCs decreased (from 2.53 to 1.84 g•dL−1 and from 20% to 10%, respectively). Time and frequency domain HRV parameters exhibited significant increases (18%-29%) with HRC remaining unchanged. Conclusions: The current case report results indicated that a multimodal training program designed for the development of various physical capacities improved exercise performance, hematological function, and cardiac autonomic control that may improve long-term prognosis for SMM. Examination of similar exercise training regimens for hematological and other cancer populations may assist in the development of simple nonpharmacological treatments for improved prognosis.

Apart from the ventilatory limitations, patients with COPD present an impaired exercise capacity that limits their ability to perform the activities of daily living and impacts negatively on their quality of life. Limb muscle dysfunction is a systemic consequence of COPD associated with exercise intolerance, poor quality of life and increased mortality. This COPD-related syndrome is characterized by reduced muscle cross-sectional area, strength and endurance, and is highly prevalent among COPD patients. Thus, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is recommended in order to combat the negative consequences of COPD on patients' exercise capacity and quality of life. Exercise training is regarded as the cornerstone of PR and can be implemented at any stage of the disease. To date, the combination of resistance and endurance training (i.e. concurrent training) has demonstrated to be the most beneficial exercise intervention in COPD. Concurrent training provides clinically and statistically significant benefits in exercise tolerance and quality of life to patients with COPD. In addition, there are other potential adjuncts to exercise training and strategies to enhance the implementation of PR programs in COPD patients.

These deficits make it challenging to sustain homeostasis required for the demands of everyday life. Exercise is likely the best therapy to reverse frailty status. Literature to date suggests that pre-frail older adults, those with 1-2 deficits on the Cardiovascular Health Study-Frailty Phenotype (CHS-frailty phenotype), should exercise 2-3 times a week, for 45-60 min. Aerobic, resistance, flexibility, and balance training components should be incorporated but resistance and balance activities should be emphasized. On the other hand, frail (CHS -frailty phenotype ≥ 3 physical deficits) older adults should exercise 3 times per week, for 30-45 min for each session with an emphasis on aerobic training. During aerobic, balance, and flexibility training, both frail and pre-frail older adults should work at an intensity equivalent to a rating of perceived exertion of 3-4 ('somewhat hard') on the Borg CR10 scale. Resistance-training intensity should be based on a percentage of 1-repetition estimated maximum (1RM). Program onset should occur at 55% of 1RM (endurance) and progress to higher intensities of 80% of 1RM (strength) to maximize functional gains. Exercise is the medicine to reverse or mitigate frailty, preserve quality of life, and restore independent functioning in older adults at risk of frailty.

The purpose of this study was to test the gravity-independent Multi-Mode Exercise Device (M-MED) for both resistance (RE) and aerobic (AE) training stimuli. METHODS: Eight men and nine women (mean age 22.0 ± 0.4 yr) completed 5 wk of training on the M-MED: RE 4 × 7 squats 2 d/wk, and AE 4 × 4-min rowing bouts at ~90% Vo2max 3 d/wk. Pre- and post-training data collection included an aerobic capacity test, MR imaging, strength testing, and vastus lateralis muscle biopsy. RESULTS: Vo2max increased 8%, 3RM strength 18%, and quadriceps femoris cross-sectional area (CSA) 10%. Knee extensor strength increased at all isokinetic speeds tested. Subjects also demonstrated improved fatigue resistance in knee extension. At the cellular and molecular level, the biopsy revealed increases in mixed myofiber CSA (13%), citrate synthase activity (26%), total RNA concentration (24%), IGF-I mRNA (77%), and Type IIa myosin heavy chain (MHC) mRNA (8%), and a concomitant decrease in Type IIx MHC mRNA (-23%). None of the changes were gender-specific. DISCUSSION: Both the functional outcomes and biomarker changes indicate that a very low volume of M-MED exercise results in robust adaptation in the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. The M-MED has the potential to provide a wide range of countermeasure exercises and should be considered for testing in ground-based spaceflight simulation.

Design: A prospective study in which a submaximal test, a maximal short exercise capacity test (steep ramp test), and a maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2max test) were performed before and after an 18-week training program. VO2max testing, the criterion standard for the measurement of physical capacity, was compared with the submaximal test and the steep ramp test. Setting: Community hospital and physiotherapy. Participants: Thirty-seven cancer survivors (10 men, 27 women) treated with chemotherapy. The subjects' mean age +/- standard deviation (SD) was 48 +/- 11 years. Intervention: An 18-week training program including strength training, interval aerobic training, and home-based activities (endurance). Main Outcome Measures: Estimated VO2max (submaximal test) and maximal workload (steep ramp test) were assessed during the exercise tests and compared with the results of the VO2max test. Results: A paired t test showed a significant improvement in VO2max (+13 %, P &lt; .001) and maximal workload (+19 %, P &lt; .001) after the training program. This improvement was confirmed in the steep ramp test (maximal workload, +13 %, P &lt; .001) but not in the submaximal test (estimated VO2max, +4 %, P = .192). Pearson correlation quantified only a moderate correlation between the VO2max test and the submaximal test and a high correlation between the VO2max test and the steep ramp test. Intraclass correlation determined the test-retest reliability of the submaximal test (.873) and the steep ramp test (.996). A linear regression model (VO2max, 6.7; steep ramp Wmax, +356.7) was estimated to predict VO2max from the steep ramp test outcome, implying a prediction margin of +/- 2 SDs (616 mL/min). Conclusions: The submaximal test proved to be invalid, whereas the steep ramp test seems to be a practicable, reliable, and valid test for the assessment of the training dose. The steep ramp test can be regularly repeated during the training program, providing information needed to readjust the training dose according to the progress made.

Methods: The PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases were accessed in September 2020. Clinical trials that evaluated the effects of physical training on neuromuscular parameters (maximum strength, resistance strength, muscle power, muscle quality, and muscle thickness) of patients with T1DM compared with a control group were considered eligible. The results were presented as the standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. Effect size (ES) calculations were performed using the fixed effect method, with α =.05. Results: Combined training increased the maximum strength levels in individuals with T1DM to a lesser extent than in healthy individuals (ES: 0.363; P =.038). Strength training increased the maximum strength (ES: 1.067; P <.001), as well as combined training (ES: 0.943; P <.001); both compared with aerobic training in patients with T1DM. Strength training increased the maximum strength in a similar magnitude to combined training in patients with T1DM (ES: −0.114; P =.624).

Data sources: A systematic search was conducted of electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, The Cochrane Library), trial registries and conference abstracts (Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand Annual Scientific Meeting, the European Respiratory Society Congress, the American Thoracic Society International Conference). Review methods: Studies were included if they (1) recruited adults hospitalized with an acute or chronic respiratory condition, (2) described an exercise programme that targeted peripheral muscles and (3) reported that ⩾80% of the sample had initiated training within 72 hours of hospitalization. Results: The last search was conducted on 2 June 2019. Of the 6282 records identified, 20 met the study criteria. These described 18 separate studies (2018 participants). Studies were conducted in adults hospitalized with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or with community-acquired pneumonia. The content of exercise programmes included aerobic and/or resistance training, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, whole-body vibration or movement out of bed. In eight studies (44%), the initial session was prescribed using objective measures of exercise capacity, peripheral muscle force and the ability to undertake activities of daily living. Across 7420 training sessions, seven adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Methods used to prescribe and titrate exercise programmes in adults hospitalized with an acute or an exacerbation of a chronic respiratory condition were disparate. When reported, programmes were well tolerated and adverse events were infrequent. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=141048104&site=ehost-live"

Peak aerobic capacity and exercise hemodynamics, arterial compliance, 24-h blood pressure, muscle strength, lean body mass, CVD risk score, and QOL were assessed before and after 12 weeks. The change in peak aerobic capacity (EST: 2.6 ± 3.1 vs. UC: -0.5 ± 2.5 mL/(kg·min)), cardiac output (EST: 1.7 ± 2.6 vs. UC: -0.01 ± 0.8 L/min), leg press (EST: 48.7 ± 34.1 vs. UC: -10.5 ± 37.7 kg) and leg extension strength (EST: 9.5 ± 10.3 vs. UC: 0.65 ± 5.5 kg) improved significantly after EST compared with UC. The overall change in QOL improved significantly after 12 weeks of EST compared with UC. No significant difference was found between groups for lean body mass, arterial compliance, 24-h blood pressure or CVD risk score. Supervised EST is an effective intervention to improve peak exercise aerobic capacity and cardiac output, muscle strength and QOL in clinically stable RTR.

Nephrology 16: 626–632. [Prepared by Mark Elkins, Journal Editor.] Objective: To review the effects of exercise training on cardiovascular fitness, cardiac function, strength, quality of life and safety in people on regular haemodialysis for chronic renal disease. Data Sources: CENTRAL, Embase, Medline and CINAHL, searched up to December 2010. Reference lists of included studies were hand searched for further eligible trials. Study selection: Randomised controlled trials involving people with chronic renal disease on regular haemodialysis, in which exercise training was compared to no training or in which different exercise modalities were compared. Trials assessing peak oxygen consumption as a measure of cardiopulmonary fitness were included. Other outcome measures were cardiac function, strength, quality of life, and safety. Exercise adherence was also considered. Data extraction: : Two reviewers determined the eligibility of studies. Methodological quality was assessed using the Jadad scale. Results: Of 69 studies initially identified by the searches, 15 studies involving a total of 565 participants were eligible and were included in the review. Study quality ranged from 1 to 3 out of 5 on the Jadad scale. Eight studies involving 365 participants compared cardiovascular fitness between training and control groups. The pooled result showed significantly greater peak oxygen consumption in the training group by 5mL per kg per min (95% CI 4 to 7). Subgroup analyses indicated that this effect was greater among studies where the exercise training was of longer duration, was not performed during dialysis, and included strength training as opposed to aerobic training alone. The exercise group also had significantly lower heart rate variability (ie, heart rate SD reduced by 16, 95% CI 8 to 24) and tended to have greater left ventricular ejection fraction (by 5%, 95% CI 0 to 9). Two studies measured cross-sectional area of limb muscles. Both showed significantly greater improvement in the exercise group, but only one also showed significantly greater strength. The effect of exercise training on quality of life was not clear, however the exercise training appeared to be safe with no deaths reported during exercise training. Among those patients originally approached about participation, 25% were ineligible due to comorbidities and a further 28% refused to participate. Of those who commenced exercise, 15% withdrew, which was similar to the dropout rate in the control group. Conclusion: Exercise training is safe, substantially improves cardiovascular fitness and reduces cardiac variability. To maximise the effect on cardiovascular fitness, the training should be longterm, be performed outside of haemodialysis periods, and include strength as well as aerobic training.

Design Open-label trial. Change was assessed by the chi-square test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Setting Physiotherapy practices. Participants Mildly affected adult patients with Pompe disease who were not dependent on ventilators and/or walking devices and were receiving enzyme replacement therapy. Intervention Patients participated in a 12-week exercise program, which included 36 sessions of standardized aerobic, resistance, and core stability exercises. Main Outcome Measures Before and after the training program we evaluated fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), pain (yes/no), motor function (Quantitative Muscle Function Test, Rasch-built Pompe-specific Activity Scale), amount of physical activity (activity monitor), and health status (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey). Results Of the 25 patients enrolled, 23 completed the program. At the end of the program, levels of fatigue (median, 5.33 to 4.78, P =.01) and pain (56.5% to 21.7%, P =.04) improved. The quality of motor function and the amount of physical activity patients engaged in did not change. Changes in pain and fatigue were not related to improvements in aerobic fitness or muscle strength. Conclusions This study in mildly affected adult patients with Pompe disease suggests that a combined training program aiming to increase aerobic fitness, muscle strength, and core stability also leads to improvements in fatigue and pain.

Currently, it is unknown if chronic exercise training can mitigate the metabolic dysfunction observed in breast cancer survivors (BCS). PURPOSE: To assess differences in substrate utilization between BCS and sedentary-healthy controls (HC) before and after a community-based exercise training program. METHODS: Early stage (0-III), non-metastatic BCS (n=28, age 55±11, BMI 27.4±4.9kg/m²) and age-matched HC (n=15, age 54±8, BMI 29.3±4.9kg/m²) completed a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) before and after a 16-week combined aerobic and resistance training intervention. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) values were derived based on percentages of absolute peak power output (PPO) achieved during the CPET, along with 3-minute post-exercise blood lactate (3MBL) measures, to estimate substrate utilization. RESULTS: Prior to training, overall RER values increased from 40% to 60% to 70% of PPO (0.84±0.06; 0.93±0.07; 0.98±0.07), with all values being different from each other (all p<0.001), with no group differences. There was a trend towards group differences in 3MBL (BCS: 6.4±1.9 mmol/L, HC: 7.2± 2.0 mmol/L, p=0.072). Following training, CPET PPO increased in BCS (Δ16.3±2.5 W, p<0.001) and HC (Δ6.7±2.5 W, p=0.020). However, RER values were unchanged with training at each intensity. Overall, 3MBL trended towards being higher (PRE: 6.9±1.9 mmol/L, POST: 7.5±2.1 mmol/L, p=0.075). CONCLUSIONS: There were no observed differences in substrate utilization during acute exercise between groups, in contrast to previous work. Additionally, RER at various intensities was not impacted by the training intervention, which may be due to a lack of a steady state during the CPET. Greater PPO after training may have allowed BCS and HC to work at a higher wattage relative to RER, which could have diminished differences in RER. While BL was lower in BCS before training, the response in both groups appeared to increase following the intervention and may reflect improved carbohydrate metabolism.

Introduction: This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of a new integrated aerobic and resistance exercise training prescription (SPRINT) using two different sets of exercise equipment: a suite of large International Space Station–like exercise equipment similar to what is found on the International Space Station and a single device with aerobic and resistance exercise capability in the spaceflight analog of bed rest (BR). Methods: Subjects (n = 34) completed 70 d of 6° head down tilt BR: 9 were randomized to remain sedentary (CONT), 9 to exercise training using traditional equipment (EX), 8 to exercise using traditional equipment and low-dose testosterone supplementation (ExT), and 8 to exercise using a combined resistance and aerobic flywheel device. Peak aerobic capacity, ventilatory threshold, cardiac morphology and function (echocardiography), muscle mass (magnetic resonance imaging) and strength/power (isokinetic, leg press, and vertical jump), and bone health (bone mineral density, blood and urine bone markers) were assessed before and after BR. Results: The SPRINT protocol mitigated BR-induced muscle and cardiac deconditioning regardless of the exercise device used. Molecular markers of bone did not change in the CONT or EX groups. Peak aerobic capacity was maintained from pre- to post-BR in all exercise groups similarly, whereas significant declines were observed in the CONT group (~10%). Significant interaction effects between the CONT group and all EX groups were observed for muscle performance including leg press total work, isokinetic upper and lower leg strength, vertical jump power, and maximal jump height as well as muscle size. Conclusions: This is the first trial to evaluate multisystem deconditioning and the role of an integrated exercise countermeasure. These findings have important implications for the design and implementation of exercise-based countermeasures on future long-duration spaceflight missions.

Methods A literature search was conducted in relevant databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception. Selected studies examined the effect of aerobic training (AET), resistance training (RT), or combined training (COM) on IMAT as assessed by noninvasive magnetic resonance imagery or computed tomography. Eligibility was determined using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Data extraction was performed using the population (P), intervention (I), comparison (C), outcome (O), timing (T), and settings (S) approach. Methodological quality was analyzed by the Cochrane risk of bias assessment. Standardized effect sizes (ES) with 95% CIs were calculated. Heterogeneity among studies was quantified using I2 statistics. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were included. Risk of publication bias was examined by the Egger regression test. Results Nineteen RCTs included 962 adults (628 women; age range = 34.8–93.4 years) with different chronic conditions that participated in 10 AET, 12 RT, and 5 COM interventions. The quality of studies was deemed moderate. Overall, the effect of exercise on IMAT was small (ES = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.37; heterogeneity I2 = 0.0%) compared with no exercise or control interventions. Moderate-intensity AET and COM had larger ES compared with RT regardless of intensity. This effect was associated with exercise-induced body weight and fat mass losses. Subgroup analysis revealed larger ES in studies assessing IMAT by magnetic resonance imagery compared with computed tomography in adults and middle-aged individuals compared with older adults and in participants who were HIV+ compared with other diagnoses. Conclusion AET and COM of moderate intensity reduce IMAT in individuals from 18 to 65 years of age who are affected by chronic diseases. This effect is associated with exercise-induced body weight and fat mass losses. In older individuals who are frail and patients at an advanced disease stage, exercise may result in a paradoxical IMAT accumulation. Impact In people affected by chronic conditions, IMAT accumulation induces muscle mass and strength losses, decline in physical performance, inflammation, and metabolic alterations. The present study shows that moderate-intensity AET or COM prevent or reduce IMAT in these conditions. Thus, the deleterious effect of IMAT on skeletal muscle homeostasis may be reverted by a properly prescribed exercise regime. The findings of the present systematic review are critical for physical therapists and health care professionals because they emphasize the therapeutic role of exercise and provide recommendations for exercise prescription that ultimately may have a positive impact on the course of disease, recovery of functionality, and independence. Lay Summary Aerobic exercise (eg, walking/jogging, cycling) alone or combined with resistance exercise (strength training with free-weights, kettle bells, or gym equipment) is effective in reducing fat streaks that infiltrate muscles and impair muscle function and growth, particularly in adults affected by chronic diseases.

After familiarization sessions, 19 subjects aged 47 +/- 2 yr (mean +/- SE) undertook a randomized, crossover design study of the effect of 8 wk of supervised circuit training consisting of combined aerobic and resistance exercise. Peak oxygen uptake VO2peak), sum of 7 maximal voluntary contractions and the sum of 8 skinfolds and 5 segment girths were determined at entry, crossover, and 16 wk. Endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular function were determined by forearm strain-gauge plethysmography and intrabrachial infusions of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in 16 subjects. Training did not alter ACh or SNP responses. VO2peak (28.6 +/- 1.1 to 32.6 +/- 1.3 mL.kg-1.min-1, P &lt; 0.001), exercise test duration (17.4 +/- 1.1 to 22.1 +/- 1.2 min, P &lt; 0.001), and muscular strength (465 +/- 27 to 535 +/- 27 kg, P &lt; 0.001) significantly increased after the exercise program, whereas skinfolds decreased (144 +/- 10 vs 134 +/- 9 mm, P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that moderate intensity circuit training designed to minimize the involvement of the arms improves functional capacity, body composition, and strength in healthy, middle-aged subjects without significantly influencing upper limb vascular function. This finding contrasts with previous studies in subjects with type 2 diabetes and heart failure that employed an identical training program.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-799467&site=ehost-live"

In addition, we compared the type and duration of exercise-based CR protocols to determine which ones produced the best performance improvements. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported in accordance with PRISMA statement. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus and ProQuest, was performed in July 2020. Studies that met the following criteria were included: (i) participants submitted to myocardial revascularization (i.e., coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)), (ii) participants submitted to exercise-based CR, and (iii) participants submitted to protocols for assessing physical performance before and after the exercise-based CR. Results: Thirteen and eleven studies evaluating the effects of exercise-based CR after myocardial revascularization were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Exercise-based CR increased physical performance after myocardial revascularization (mean effect size (ES) 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62, 0.88), particularly when aerobic (ES 0.85; 95% CI 0.68, 1.01) and combined training (ES 1.04; 95% CI 0.70, 1.38) lasting 8-12 weeks (ES 1.20; 95% CI 0.87, 1.53) was prescribed. Conclusions: The present systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that exercise-based CR increases physical performance after myocardial revascularization. The prescription of physical training for these patients should emphasize aerobic and combined training lasting at least 8-12 weeks, which is more effective in improving physical performance. Impact: Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of physical training in improving physical performance after myocardial revascularization.

Maximal tolerated power (MTP), peak values of oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and heart rate (HRpeak), anaerobic threshold (VT1) were determined during an incremental cycling exercise test before and after training periods. TL, quantified using the session rating of perceived exertion, did not differ between both modalities (CT:4438±572 vs. AT: 4346±592 AU, p = 0.300). Improvements in VO2peak were larger after CT (+ 36.4±24.7% of pre-training VO2peak, i.e., +4.4± 2.3 mL.min-1.kg-1, n=14) than observed after AT (+ 20.1 ±9.1% of pre-training VO2peak, i.e., +2.6±1.0mL.min-1.kg-1, n = 12) (p = 0.014). Additionally, CT significantly improved power (54.6±23.8 vs. 75.1 ±21.2 watts, p = 0.001) and VO2 associated at VT1 (VO2: 9.8 ±2.5 vs. 12.6±2.9mL.min-1.kg-1, p = 0.001). This might be taken into account when prescribing exercise rehabilitation for CHD patients with different initial clinical limitations.

Ten men performed acute unilateral AE + RE interspersed by 15 min recovery. The contralateral leg was subjected to RE. This exercise paradigm was then implemented in a 5-wk training program. Protein phosphorylation, gene expression, and glycogen content were assessed in biopsies obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of both legs immediately before and 3 h after acute RE. Quadriceps muscle size and in vivo torque were measured, and muscle samples were analyzed for citrate synthase activity and glycogen concentration, before and after training. Acute AE reduced glycogen content (32%; P < 0.05) and increased (P < 0.05) phosphorylation of AMPK (1.5-fold) and rpS6 (1.3-fold). Phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 remained unchanged. Myostatin gene expression was downregulated after acute AE + RE but not RE. Muscle size showed greater (P < 0.05) increase after AE + RE (6%) than RE (3%) training. Citrate synthase activity (18%) and endurance performance (22%) increased (P < 0.05) after AE + RE but not RE. While training increased (P < 0.05) in vivo muscle strength in both legs, normalized and concentric torque increased after RE only. Thus AE activates AMPK, reduces glycogen stores, and impairs the progression of concentric force, yet muscle hypertrophic responses to chronic RE training appear not to be compromised.

In the present study, we examined the effects of exercise training on glucose metabolism, abdominal adiposity, and adipocytokines in obese elderly. Sixteen obese men and women (age = 63 ± 1 yr, body mass index = 33.2 ± 1.4 kg/m²) participated in a 12-wk supervised exercise program (5 days/wk, 60 min/day, treadmill/cycle ergometry at 85% of heart rate maximum). Visceral fat (VF), subcutaneous fat, and total abdominal fat were measured by computed tomography. Fat mass and fat-free mass were assessed by hydrostatic weighing. An oral glucose tolerance test was used to determine changes in insulin resistance. Exercise training increased maximal oxygen consumption (21.3 ± 0.8 vs. 24.3 ± 1.0 ml·kg-1·min-1, P < 0.0001), decreased body weight (P < 0.0001) and fat mass (P < 0.001), while fat-free mass was not altered (P > 0.05).

Damaged elements are continuously degraded and its constituents recycled to produce renovated structures through a process called autophagy, which is essential for the adaptation to training. Autophagy is particularly active in skeletal muscle, where it can be evaluated using specific molecular markers of activation (unc‐51‐like kinase 1 [ULK1] phosphorylation) and specific proteins indicating increased autophagosome content (increased total LC3, LC3‐II, LC3‐II/LC3‐I ratio). Studies in humans are technically limited but have provided evidence suggesting the activation of autophagy in skeletal muscle through AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream target ULK1. Autophagy activation is more likely when the intensity is elevated and the exercise performed in the fasted state. The autophagy‐gene program and autophagosome content are upregulated after ultraendurance running competitions. However, autophagosome content is reduced after endurance exercise at moderate intensities (50% and 70% of VO2max) for 60‐120 minutes. Autophagosome content is decreased within the first few hours after resistance training. The effects of regular endurance and strength training on basal autophagy remain to be established in humans. One study has reported that acute severe hypoxia increases autophagosome content in human skeletal muscle, which is reverted by 20 minutes of low‐intensity exercise. Experiments with transgenic mice have shown that autophagy is necessary for skeletal muscle adaptation to training. Little is known on how genetic factors, environment, nutrition, drugs and diseases may interact with exercise to modulate autophagy at rest and during exercise in humans.

Defined as the oxygen uptake required at a given submaximal running velocity, it has been considered a key aerobic parameter related to endurance running performance. In this context, concurrent strength and endurance training has been considered an effective method, although conclusions on the optimal concurrent training cannot yet be drawn. Objective: To evaluate the effect of concurrent training on RE in endurance running athletes and identify the effects of subject characteristics and concurrent training variables on the magnitude of RE improvement. Methods: We conducted a computerized search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases, and references of original studies were searched for further relevant studies. The analysis comprised 20 effects in 16 relevant studies published up to August 2015. The outcomes were calculated as the difference in percentage change between control and experimental groups (% change) and data were presented as mean ± 95 % confidence limit. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model and, in addition, simple and multiple meta-regression analyses were used to identify effects of age, training status, number of sessions per week, training duration, type of strength training, and neuromuscular performance on % change in RE. Results: The concurrent training program had a small beneficial effect on RE (% change = −3.93 ± 1.19 %; p < 0.001). In addition, explosive (% change = −4.83 ± 1.53; p < 0.001) and heavy weight (% change = −3.65 ± 2.74; p = 0.009) training programs produced similar improvements in RE, while isometric training (% change = −2.20 ± 4.37; p = 0.324) in selected studies did not induce a significant effect. The multiple linear meta-regression analysis showed that all the differences between % changes could be explained by including the above-mentioned characteristics of subjects and weight training program elements. This model showed that the magnitude of the % change in RE was larger for longer training duration ( β = −0.83 ± 0.72, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Explosive training and heavy weight training are effective concurrent training methods aiming to improve RE within a few weeks. However, long-term training programs seem to be necessary when the largest possible improvement in RE is desired.

The total training volume was kept the same in both groups, but 32% of training in E and 3% in C was replaced by explosive-type strength training. A 5-km time trial (5K), running economy (RE), maximal 20-m speed (V20 m), and 5-jump (5J) tests were measured on a track. Maximal anaerobic (MART) and aerobic treadmill running tests were used to determine maximal velocity in the MART (VMART) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max ). The 5K time, RE, and VMART improved (P <0.05) in E, but no changes were observed in C. V20 m and 5J increased in E (P <0.01) and decreased in C (P <0.05). VO2 max increased in C (P <0.05), but no changes were observed in E. In the pooled data, the changes in the 5K velocity during 9 weeks of training correlated (P <0.05) with the changes in RE [O2 uptake (r =-0.54)] and VMART (r =0.55). In conclusion, the present simultaneous explosive-strength and endurance training improved the 5K time in well-trained endurance athletes without changes in their VO2 max . This improvement was due to improved neuromuscular characteristics that were transferred into improved VMART and running economy.

Subjects' enjoyment and implementation intentions were also examined prior to and following training. Subjects (22 recreationally active females (20.3 ± 1.4 years)) completed 4 weeks of exercise training 4 days per week consisting of either 30 min of endurance treadmill training (~85% maximal heart rate; n = 7) or whole-body aerobic-resistance training involving one set of 8 × 20 s of a single exercise (burpees, jumping jacks, mountain climbers, or squat thrusts) separated by 10 s of rest per session ( n = 7). A third group was assigned to a nontraining control group ( n = 8). Following training, O2peak was increased in both the endurance (~7%) and interval (~8%) groups ( p < 0.05), whereas muscle endurance was improved ( p < 0.05) in the interval group (leg extensions, +40%; chest presses, +207%; sit-ups, +64%; push-ups, +135%; and back extensions, +75%). Perceived enjoyment of, and intentions to engage in, very low volume, high-intensity, whole-body interval exercise were both increased following training ( p < 0.05). No significant changes were observed for any variable in the control (nontraining) group. These data demonstrate that although improvements in cardiovascular fitness are induced by both endurance and extremely low volume interval-style training, whole-body aerobic-resistance training imparted addition benefit in the form of improved skeletal muscle endurance.

Due to this popularity, both coaches and runners are interested on learning about the factors that affect long-distance running performance. Facing this new reality, scientific literature has been concerned about the aforementioned factors, and the amount of studies has considerably grown. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to analyse factors affecting long-distance running performance from different points of view. Literature review was performed through 3 different databases (Medline, SportDiscus and Google Scholar) and the factors were classified into 5 main groups, subdivided into different sections: 1- environmental (air/wind, temperature, humidity, altitude and slope of the ground), 2- training-related (endurance, resistance, training in hot environments and in altitude), 3- physiological (VO2max, thersholds, running economy, age, gender, muscle fibre type, fatigue and race), 4- biomechanical (anthropometry, leg-stiffness, flexibility, foot strike pattern, footwear, foot orthoses and spatio-temporal parameters) and 5- psychological (intervention strategies, direction of attention and music). Even though the influence of some of these factors on running performance is quite well-known, the influence of some psychological (direction of attention and music) and biomechanical factors (foot strike pattern and spatio-temporal parameters) is still unclear. There are few studies or the results cannot be generalized. Future studies and the progress of new technologies and measurement tools will provide a better understanding.

Taking body mass (BM) into consideration, runners with good RE use less energy and therefore less oxygen than runners with poor RE at the same velocity. There is a strong association between RE and distance running performance, with RE being a better predictor of performance than maximal oxygen uptake (V-dotO2max) in elite runners who have a similar V-dotO2max. RE is traditionally measured by running on a treadmill in standard laboratory conditions, and, although this is not the same as overground running, it gives a good indication of how economical a runner is and how RE changes over time. In order to determine whether changes in RE are real or not, careful standardisation of footwear, time of test and nutritional status are required to limit typical error of measurement. Under controlled conditions, RE is a stable test capable of detecting relatively small changes elicited by training or other interventions. When tracking RE between or within groups it is important to account for BM. As V-dotO2 during submaximal exercise does not, in general, increase linearly with BM, reporting RE with respect to the 0.75 power of BM has been recommended. A number of physiological and biomechanical factors appear to influence RE in highly trained or elite runners. These include metabolic adaptations within the muscle such as increased mitochondria and oxidative enzymes, the ability of the muscles to store and release elastic energy by increasing the stiffness of the muscles, and more efficient mechanics leading to less energy wasted on braking forces and excessive vertical oscillation. Interventions to improve RE are constantly sought after by athletes, coaches and sport scientists. Two interventions that have received recent widespread attention are strength training and altitude training. Strength training allows the muscles to utilise more elastic energy and reduce the amount of energy wasted in braking forces. Altitude exposure enhances discrete metabolic aspects of skeletal muscle, which facilitate more efficient use of oxygen. The importance of RE to successful distance running is well established, and future research should focus on identifying methods to improve RE. Interventions that are easily incorporated into an athlete’s training are desirable. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=13662995&site=ehost-live"

By using the meta-analytic approach, studies that met the following criteria were included in our analyses: 1) at least six subjects per group; 2) subject groups consisting of children in the 5- to 17-yr age range; 3) pretest and posttest values for either body mass, percent body fat, or fat-free mass (FFM); 4) used exercise as a mode of treatment (e.g., walking, jogging, cycle ergometry, high-repetition resistance exercise, and combinations); 6) training programs 3 wk; 7) full-length publications (not conference proceedings); 8) apparently ""healthy"" children (i.e., free from endocrine diseases and disorders); and 9) published studies in English language journals only. A total of 120 investigations were located that addressed the issue of exercise as a method of treatment in pediatric obesity. Of those, 30 met our criteria for inclusion. Across all designs and categories, fixed-effects modeling yielded significant decreases in the following dependent variables: 1) percent body fat (mean = 0.70 +/- 0.35; 95 % CI = 0.21 to 1.1); 2) FFM (mean = 0.50 +/- 0.38; 95 % CI = 0.03 to 0.57); 3) body mass (mean = 0.34 +/- 0.18; 95 % CI = 0.01 to 0.46); 4) BMI (mean = 0.76 +/- 0.55; 95 % CI = 4.24 to 1.7), and 5) VO2max (mean = 0.52 +/- 0.16; 95 % CI = 0.18 to 0.89), respectively. Significant differences were found as a function of the type intervention groups (exercise vs exercise + behavioral modification; P &lt; 0.04); body composition assessment methods (skinfold vs hydrostatic weighing, DEXA, and total body water; P &lt; 0.006); exercise intensity (60-65 %, vs greater than or equal to 71 % VO2max; P &lt; 0.01); duration (less than or equal to 30 min vs &gt; 30 min; P &lt; 0.03); and mode (aerobic vs aerobic + resistance training; P &lt; 0.02). Stepwise linear regression suggested that initial body fat levels (or body mass), type of treatment intervention, exercise intensity, and exercise mode accounted for most of the variance associated with changes in body composition after training. Exercise is efficacious for reducing selected body composition variables in children and adolescents. The most favorable alterations in body composition occurred with 1) low-intensity, long-duration exercise; 2) aerobic exercise combined with high-repetition resistance training; and 3) exercise programs combined with a behavioral-modification component.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-817757&site=ehost-live"

This might be especially attractive during medical treatment. Long-term effects have to be evaluated in randomized controlled studies also with a longer follow-up. Implications for Rehabilitation: High-intensity interval training allows improvement of aerobic capacity within a comparable short time. Standard leisure training in breast cancer patients is rather suitable for the maintenance of performance capacity and quality of life. Guided high-intensity interval training combined with strength training can be used effectively for the improvement of endurance and strength capacity and also quality of life. After exclusion of contraindications, guided adjuvant high-intensity interval training combined with strength training can be safely used in breast cancer patients ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=128681880&site=ehost-live"

Thirty-eight young men with different training background participated: 9 endurance runners, 10 power-trained individuals, 9 strength-trained individuals, and 10 sedentary individuals. They performed maximal isometric leg press for the measurement of RFD. Body composition (dual x-ray absorptiometry) and vastus lateralis fiber type composition were also evaluated. When all participants were examined as a group, moderate correlations were found between the percent of type II muscle fibers and RFD between 100 and 600 milliseconds (r = 0.321-0.497; p ≤ 0.05). The correlation coefficients were higher for the cross-sectional area (CSA) and the %CSA of type II and IIx muscle fibers (r = 0.599-0.847; p < 0.001). For the power group, RFD up to 250 milliseconds highly correlated with % type IIx muscle fibers and type IIx fiber CSA (r = 0.670-0.826; p ≤ 0.05), as well as with %CSA of type IIx fibers (r = 0.714-0.975; p ≤ 0.05). Significant correlations were found between the relative RFD (⋅kg-1 lower extremities lean mass) and CSA-%CSA of type II and IIx fibers for the power group (r = 0.676-0.903; p ≤ 0.05). No significant correlations were found between muscle morphology and RFD for the other groups. In conclusion, the present data suggest that there is a strong link between the type IIx muscle fibers and early RFD and relative RFD in power-trained participants. Type II fibers seem to be moderately linked with RFD in non--power-trained individuals.

This study investigated the effects of moderate frequency E+S versus S+E training on physical fitness, body composition, and blood lipids. Methods: Physically active and healthy young men performed E+S (n = 16) or S+E (n = 18) training 2-3 times a week for 24 wk. Endurance (by incremental bike test) and strength (by dynamic leg press) performance as well as body composition (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), muscle cross-sectional area of vastus lateralis (by ultrasound), and blood lipid levels were determined before and after the intervention. Results: Time to exhaustion, aerobic power (W), and one-repetition maximum strength significantly increased in the two groups at week 24 (E+S, 12%—15%, P = 0.003-0.001; S+E, 16%—17%, P < 0.001), but no between-group difference was observed. Similarly, the two groups significantly increased total lean mass (E+S, 3%; S+E, 3%; both P = 0.001) and muscle cross-sectional area (E+S, 14%, P = 0.001; S+E, 16%, P < 0.001) at week 24 to a similar extent. No significant changes in body fat or blood lipid levels were observed in either of the two groups at week 24. Conclusions: These results showed that moderate-frequency (2-3 times per week) combined E+S or S+E training led to significant improvements in physical fitness and lean body mass but did not induce significant changes in body fat or blood lipid levels. Furthermore, because no between-group differences were observed, these results indicate that loading order does not seem to affect training adaptations of healthy moderately active young men.

Physically active, healthy male and female participants (aged 18-40 years) performed strength and endurance sessions on different days (DD; men, n = 21; women, n = 18) or in the same session with endurance preceding strength (ES; men, n = 16; women, n = 15) or vice versa (SE; men, n = 18; women, n = 14). The training volume was matched in all groups. Maximal leg press strength (1-repetition maximum (1RM)) and endurance performance (maximal oxygen consumption during cycling), body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and blood lipids were measured. 1RM and maximal oxygen consumption increased in all groups in men (12%-17%, p < 0.001; and 7%-18%, p < 0.05-0.001, respectively) and women (13%-21%, p < 0.01-0.001; and 10%-25%, p < 0.01-0.001, respectively). Maximal oxygen consumption increased more in DD vs. ES and SE both in men ( p = 0.003-0.008) and women ( p = 0.008-0.009). Total body lean mass increased in all groups (3%-5%, p < 0.01-0.001). Only DD led to decreased total body fat (men, −14% ± 15%, p < 0.001; women, −13% ± 14%, p = 0.009) and abdominal-region fat (men, −18% ± 14%, p = 0.003; women, −17% ± 15%, p = 0.003). Changes in blood lipids were correlated with changes in abdominal-region fat in the entire group ( r = 0.283, p = 0.005) and in DD ( r = 0.550, p = 0.001). In conclusion, all modes resulted in increased physical fitness and lean mass, while only DD led to decreases in fat mass. Same-session SE and ES combined training is effective in improving physical fitness while volume-equated, but more frequent DD training may be more suitable for optimizing body composition and may be possibly useful in early prevention of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

Additionally, the interaction of different functional capacities was studied in competitive athletes. Ten competitive tennis players and 10 endurance athletes participated in the study. Pre-exercise force-generating capacities were determined during maximal voluntary isometric knee extensions (MVC). Fatigability of the QF was studied using sustained isometric contractions with target loads of 20% and 40% of pre-exercise MVC. Postexercise MVCs were conducted 20 seconds, 1 minute, and 3 minutes post task failure. Muscle activation of the QF during the fatiguing exercises and postexercise MVCs was estimated using surface electromyography. Higher explosive force-generating capacities, but no differences in absolute moments, were detected in tennis players compared with endurance athletes. Fatigability of the QF during both fatiguing tasks was approximately the same in both athletic populations. This was indicated by minor group differences in endurance time, postexercise MVC production, and electromyography (EMG)-estimated muscle activation during fatigue. Variability in endurance time was not significantly associated with pre-exercise force-generating capacities in these competitive athletes. In both athletic populations, recovery of MVC was significantly slower after the fatiguing contraction with 20% of MVC compared with that with 40% of MVC. These results may enhance understanding of plasticity of the neuromuscular system and yield interesting information for the optimization of athletic training programs. Explosive strength training might enhance endurance athletes' explosiveness without decreasing muscle fatigue resistance. The exercise profile of competitive tennis is suggested to act as a sufficient trigger to reach high neuromuscular fatigue resistance but may be inadequate to cause significant gains in absolute muscle strength.

Fourteen female student-athletes (age 19.29 ± 0.91 years) were divided into two training groups, matched from baseline (˙VO2peak): High Intensity Training (HITrun; n = 8) and High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT; n = 6). Participants completed 12 training sessions. HITrun consisted of 30 min of high-intensity running, while HIIT consisted of a series of whole-body high intensity Tabata-style intervals (75–85% of age predicted maximum heart rate) for a total of four minutes. In addition to the interval training, the off-season training included six resistance training sessions, three team practices, and concluded with a team scrimmage.

Heat acclimation involves repeated exercise sessions in hot conditions that induce physiological and thermoregulatory adaptations that attenuate heat-induced performance impairments. Current evidence-based guidelines for heat acclimation are clear, but the application of these recommendations is not always aligned with the time commitments and training priorities of elite athletes. Alternative forms of heat acclimation investigated include hot water immersion and sauna bathing, yet uncertainty remains around the efficacy of these methods for reducing heat-induced performance impairments, as well as how this form of heat stress may add to an athlete's overall training load. An understanding of how to optimally prescribe and periodise heat acclimation based on the performance determinants of a given event is limited, as is knowledge of how heat acclimation may affect the quality of concurrent training sessions. Finally, differences in individual athlete responses to heat acclimation need to be considered. This article addresses alternative methods of heat acclimation and heat exposure, explores gaps in literature around understanding the real world application of heat acclimation for athletes, and highlights specific athlete considerations for practitioners.

Assess the changes in explosive force that can be generated after an intervention with a training program on maximum force. Materials and methods. A quasiexperimental study with pre-test and post-test design, in a cohort of older adults who, during 12 weeks, received training on maximum strength, between 44% and 54% of their MRI. The inclusion criteria were to be older adults (e»60 years);to have a body mass index of 19-30 kg / m²); to attend the physical activity program for the elderly of the Santo Tomás University in Bogotá (Colombia). Results. We found changes in the explosive force after the training; however, they are not statistically significant. Changes were found in anthropometry, this showing significant correlation with explosive force measured through SQJ. Conclusions. The results show that it is possible to generate changes in percentages of fat tissue through strength training and not exclusively with aerobic resistance. Also, it is necessary to increase the sample size in order to recognize with greater clarity the changes that can be generated in strength in elderly.

All groups ingested the same dose of GT. Blood samples were collected to analyze fasting glucose, insulin resistance, apelin and orexin-A concentrations. Insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Blood samples were collected before each exercise training and 24 h after of the last session.Results: Orexin-A and apelin were decreased significantly after all exercise training modalities, whereas no changes in response to control group. Aerobic group showed greater reduction of blood samples than resistance and combined group. No benefit of GT supplementation only (Control group) on apelin and orexin-A was observed. In addition, Correlation was found between apelin and orexin-A after exercise training.Conclusion: All training modalities cause a reduction in insulin resistance, HOMA-IR, orexin-A and apelin in obese women. 10 weeks of aerobic exercise cause greater decreases in apelin and orexin-A than resistance and combined exercise trainings. In addition, the decrease in plasma apelin levels may contribute to reduction in orexin-A levels.

"Group-based Aerobic Interval Training in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure: Norwegian Ullevaal Model.","Nilsson, Birgitta Blakstad; Hellesnes, Brit; Westheim, Arne; Risberg, May Arna","Physical Therapy",="00319023",,="20080401","88","4","523","13","31976845",,,"Article","PATIENTS; REHABILITATION; AEROBIC exercises; DISEASES; UNITED States; HEART failure patients; AMERICAN Heart Association",,"Background and Purpose The purpose of this case report is to describe the responses of 4 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) to a novel rehabilitation program: a group-based, high-intensity, interval-training program that includes aerobic, resistance, flexibility, and balance activities. Case Descriptions Four patients (55-71 years of age) with CHF (New York Heart Association class III) participated in the rehabilitation program twice per week for 16 weeks. Outcome measures included a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), a cycle ergometer test (aerobic capacity), and a quality-of-life questionnaire. Outcomes Patients 1, 2, and 3 increased their aerobic capacity (17%, 25%, and 52%, respectively). Patient 4 did not complete the cycle ergometer test because of limitations associated with his pacemaker. All patients increased their 6MWT distance (117, 66, 135, and 143 m for patients 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). No adverse events were reported. Discussion The Norwegian Ullevaal Model of cardiac rehabilitation is a novel high-intensity, interval-training program. The 4 patients with CHF in this case series who participated in this program experienced improvements in physical capacity and quality of life and had no adverse events. These results are consistent with recent evidence supporting the efficacy of high-intensity interval training in people with CHF. Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of this group-based, high-intensity, aerobic interval-training program for patients with CHF.

Eleven rowers (68.0 ± 1.6 years) and 11 sedentary control older men (64.9 ± 1.1 years) were studied. Peak oxygen uptake (36.0 ± 1.7 vs. 27.7 ±1.9 ml · kg−1 · min−1), leg press power (1346 ± 99 vs. 1077 ± 68 W), and HDL-cholesterol (75 ± 5 vs. 58 ±3 mg · ml−1) were higher and triglyceride (78 ± 9 vs. 120 ± 14 mg · ml−1) was lower in rowers than in control participants (all P < 0.05). Arterial stiffness indices (carotid β-stiffness and cardio-ankle vascular index) and plasma endothelin-1 and NOx (nitrite + nitrate) levels did not differ between the two groups. These results suggest that habitual rowing exercise in older men is associated with high muscle power and aerobic capacity, and favourable blood lipid profile without affecting arterial stiffness or plasma levels of endotheline-1 and NO.

Twenty-three male soccer players were randomly allocated into two groups: JS and HS. The mean propulsive power, vertical jumping ability, and sprinting performance were evaluated before and after 4 weeks of a preseason period. The optimum power loads for the JS and HS exercises were assessed and were used as load-references. The soccer players performed 10 power oriented training sessions in total. Both JS and HS maintained power in JS and speed abilities (P > 0.05, for main effects and interaction effect) as indicated by ANCOVA. Both groups demonstrated reduced power during HS (ES = −0.76 vs. −0.78, for JS and HS, respectively); both groups improved acceleration (ACC) from 5 to 10 m (ES = 0.52). JS was more effective at reducing the ACC decrements over 0–5 m (ES = −0.38 vs. −0.58, for JS and HS, respectively). The HS group increased squat jump height (ES = 0.76 vs. 0.11, for HS and JS, respectively). In summary, JS is more effective in reducing the ACC capacity over very short sprints while HS is more effective in improving squat jump performance. Both strategies improve ACC over longer distances. New training strategies should be implemented/developed to avoid concurrent training effects between power and endurance adaptations during professional soccer preseasons.

Purpose: We determined the effects of an innovative 8-wk exercise intervention (aerobic, resistance, and inspiratory muscle training) for patients with mitochondrial disease. Methods: Several end points were assessed in 12 patients (19–59 yr, 4 women) at pretraining, posttraining, and after 4-wk detraining: aerobic power, muscle strength/power and maximal inspiratory pressure (main end points), ability to perform activities of daily living, body composition, quality of life, and blood myokines (secondary end points). Results: The program was safe, with patients’ adherence being 94% ± 5%. A significant time effect was found for virtually all main end points (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.004), indicating a training improvement. Similar findings (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.003) were found for activities of daily living tests, total/trunk/leg lean mass, total fat mass, femoral fracture risk, and general health perception. No differences were found for blood myokines, except for an acute exertional increase in interleukin 8 at posttraining/detraining (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and in fatty acid binding protein 3 at detraining (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002).

We compared the efficiency of a serial and an integrated combined training program on health and overall fitness in middle-aged females. 54 females (46.7 ± 4.5yrs) were assigned to a serial (SCG)or an integrated (ICG) combined training group or to a control group (CG). The SCG and ICG performed a 3-month training combining aerobic dance and calisthenics. The 2 training programs differ in the sequence of aerobic and strength exercises. SCG performed the strength exercises prior to aerobic; in ICG, the aerobic and strength exercises were altered in a predetermined order. Body composition/circumferences, blood pressure, respiratory function, flexibility, balance, muscle strength/endurance, power and aerobic capacity were measured before and after training. SCG and ICG significantly increased muscle strength and endurance, power, aerobic capacity, flexibility, balance, fat-free mass and respiratory function (p < 0.001 -0.05), while significant reductions were observed for blood pressure, heart rate and body fat/circumferences (p< 0.001-0.05). However, there were no significant differences between SCG and ICG after training. Serial and integrated combined training programs confer analogous adaptations and can be used interchangeably for counteracting the detrimental effects of sedentary lifestyle on indices of physical fitness and health.

The current study investigated the effects of heat acclimation alone (H), combined with normobaric hypoxia exposure (H+NH), on endurance athletic performance. Methods: Well-trained participants completed a heat-stress trial (30 °C, 80% relative humidity (RH), 20.8% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)) of a 75 min steady-state cycling (fixed workload) and a subsequent 15 min cycling time trial for distance before and after intervention. Participants completed 12 consecutive indoor training days with either heat acclimation (H; 60 min·day−1, 30 °C, 80% RH; 20.8% FiO2) or heat acclimation and overnight hypoxic environment (H+NH; ~12 h, 60% RH; 16% FiO2 simulating altitude of ~2500 m). Control (CON) group trained outdoors with average maximum daily temperature of 16.5 °C and 60% RH. Results: Both H and H+NH significantly improved time trial cycling distance by ~5.5% compared to CON, with no difference between environmental exposures. PV increased (+3.8%) and decreased (−4.1%) following H and H+NH, respectively, whereas haemoglobin concentration decreased (−2%) and increased (+3%) in H and H+NH, respectively. Conclusion: Our results show that despite contrasting physiological adaptations to different environmental acclimation protocols, heat acclimation with or without hypoxic exposure demonstrated similar improvements in short-duration exercise performance in a hot environment.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of type of exercise on HSP72 response in active young females. Nineteen female physical education students were randomly divided into two groups: an endurance training group (ETG) and a weight training group (WTG). The exercise protocol in the ETG included incremental running to exhaustion performed at 65-75% VO on a treadmill with a 0% grade. The subjects in the WTG also performed 4 sets of eccentric contractions of elbow flexors: two sets of 25 reps at 50% 1RM and two sets of 15-20 reps at 60% 1RM. Blood sampling from antecubital vein was done at baseline level (rest), mid-exercise and 30 min post-exercise in the same conditions, after a 12-14 h overnight fast. The samples were sent to a laboratory and centrifuged, and the serum used to analyse variables. A sandwich **Elisa and enzymatic assay were used for determination of HSP72 values and creatine kinase (CK) respectively. The data were analysed with repeated measures, LSD post hoc and independent t-test at p<0.05. The results showed HSP72 level alterations in mid- and post-tests were only significant in the ERG in comparison with baseline values ( p=0.007, p=0.03 respectively). In addition, HSP72 level alterations within the ETG and WTG were only significant mid-test. Also CK levels insignificantly increased and decreased in the ETG and WTG respectively. The CK alterations in mid- and post-tests were insignificant between groups. Thus these results suggest that eccentric weight exercise induces a further increase in HSP72 levels.

Two experimental groups exercised five times weekly, namely a high-intensity concurrent training group (HiCon; n=14) and moderate-intensity concurrent training group (ModCon; n=14). The ModCon performed TKD training at 55-70% (weeks 1-2) and 70-85% (weeks 3-4) maximum heart rate (HRmax) and RT training for four sets of 10-15 repetitions for the 13 wholebody RT exercises. The HiCon performed TKD training at 85-100% (weeks 1-2) and 95-100% (weeks 3-4) HRmax and RT training for five sets of 10-15 repetitions for the 13 whole-body RT exercises. At post-test, the male HiCon demonstrated significantly (p<0.05) higher levels of red blood cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit, while the male ModCon demonstrated significantly lower monocytes and basophil levels. The female HiCon significantly increased their eosinophils, while the female ModCon significantly increased their haemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume, and decreased their red distribution width levels. This suggests that both high-intensity and moderate-intensity concurrent TKD and RT can improve selected hematological parameters, thus oxygen-carrying capacity and immune function, in even already TKD-trained athletes.

Design: Twenty male subjects with coronary artery disease (61.1 ± 4.7 years) were randomly assigned to a combined training group (resistance + aerobic) or aerobic training group (AG). Heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, minute ventilation, blood lactate, and parasympathetic modulation indices of heart rate (square root of the mean squared differences of successive RR intervals [RMSSD] and dispersion of points perpendicular to the line of identity that provides information about the instantaneous beat-to-beat variability [SD1]) were obtained before and after an 8-week RT program while performing exercise on a cycle ergometer and a 45-degree leg press. Results: Resistance training resulted in an increase in maximal and submaximal load tolerance (P < 0.01), a decreased hemodynamic response (P < 0.01), and a reduction in blood lactate in the combined training group compared to the aerobic training group during the 45-degree leg press. During exercise on a cycle ergometer, there was a decreased hemodynamic response and increased minute ventilation (P < 0.01). The 8-week RT program resulted in greater parasympathetic tone (RMSSD and SD1 ) and an increase in the SDNN index during exercise on a cycle ergometer and 45-degree leg press (P < 0.05). Conclusions: An 8-week resistance training program associated with aerobic training may attenuate hemodynamic stress, and modify metabolic and autonomic responses during resistance exercise. The training program also appeared to elicit beneficial cardiovascular and autonomic effects during exercise.

Well-trained cyclists with no strength training experience performed heavy strength training twice a week in addition to a high volume of endurance training during a 12-week preparatory period ( S + E; n = 11). A group of non-strength trained individuals performed the same strength training as S + E, but without added endurance training ( S; n = 7). Thigh muscle cross-sectional area, 1 repetition maximum (1RM) in leg exercises, squat jump performance, and peak rate of force development (RFD) were measured. Following the intervention period, both S + E and S increased 1RM strength, thigh muscle cross-sectional area, and squat jump performance ( p < 0.05), and the relative improvements in S were greater than in S + E ( p < 0.05). S increased peak RFD while S + E did not, and this improvement was greater than in S + E ( p < 0.05). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first controlled study to demonstrate that the strength training response on muscle hypertrophy, 1RM strength, squat jump performance, and peak RFD is attenuated in well-trained endurance athletes during a period of concurrent endurance training.

The HIBWT group performed a training protocol (length time ∼ 20 min) consisting of ten sets of 60 s of high intensity exercise (30 s of stepping up and down on a step and 30s of squatting up and down with body weight as fast as possible) interspersed by a recovery period of 60 s of low intensity exercise. The COMT group performed a training protocol (length time ∼ 60-min) consisting of a 30 min walk of moderate intensity following by five resistance exercises (three sets of 8–12 repetitions at 70% of 1RM, with a 1.5-min rest period between sets and exercises). All training sessions were performed in the university gym facility three days a week (no consecutive days) for 12 weeks. Body fat (DXA), muscle mass (DXA) and muscle strength (1RM) were assessed at the baseline and at the end of the study. Results Both groups reduce similarly body fat percentage. Both groups increased ( P < 0.05) muscle mass and muscle strength; however, COMT showed greater muscle strength gains and HIBWT showed greater muscle mass gains. Conclusions HIBWT and COMT promote fat mass loss and muscle mass and strength gains in young women. However, HIBWT promotes greater muscle mass gains than COMT, whereas COMT promotes greater muscle strength gains than HIBWT.

Objective: To assess the effects of HIIT that utilizes resistive elastic bands to improve overhand throwing velocity. Participants: Healthy female volunteers (n = 13) ranging in age from 18-29 years. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or an experimental group that exercised 3 days per week for 3 weeks. Each training session involved performance of 5 sets of 20 throwing motions against elastic band resistance, which was performed by both extremities. Main Outcome Measures: Maximal oxygen consumption was measured during performance of a graded exercise test that utilized an upper extremity cycle ergometer. A radar gun was used to assess peak throwing velocity and the extent to which throwing velocity was sustained during performance of a 20-throw endurance test. Results: After completing the training, the experimental group exhibited faster peak throwing velocity (61.6 ± 6.6 km/hr to 63.2 ± 8.6 km/hr) and a reduced fatigue index (1.18 ± 0.16 to 1.01 ± 0.02). Training also resulted in a 14% improvement in maximum oxygen consumption (1.40 ± 0.46 L/min to 1.60 ± 0.49 L/ min) and longer time to fatigue (9.99 ± 1.84 min to 11.43 ± 2.29 min).

However, critical power (CP), capillarization, and myofiber size remain unaffected by this addition. Therefore, we tested whether the superimposition of resistance exercise with whole-body vibration and vascular occlusion (vibroX) would improve these variables in endurance-trained males relative to resistance exercise alone. Methods: Twenty-one young, endurance-trained males were randomly assigned either to a vibroX ( n = 11) or resistance ( n = 10) training group. Both groups trained in a progressive mode twice a week for 8 weeks. Pre and post training, histochemical muscle characteristics, thigh muscle size, endurance and strength parameters were determined. Results: vibroX increased CP ( P = 0.001), overall capillary-to-fiber ratio ( P = 0.001) and thigh lean mass ( P < 0.001), while these parameters were unaffected by resistance training. The gain in CP by vibroX was positively correlated with the gain in capillarization ( R = 0.605, P = 0.008), and the gain in thigh lean mass was paralleled by increases in MyHC-1 and MyHC-2 fiber cross-sectional areas and strength. Maximum voluntary torque and the finite work capacity above CP ( W′) increased significantly only following resistance training. Conclusions: We achieved a proof of concept by demonstrating that modification of resistance exercise by superimposing side-alternating whole-body vibration and sustained vascular occlusion induced further improvements in CP, capillarization and hypertrophy, all of which were not observed with resistance training alone.

It occurs due to hemodynamic alterations that modify the cardiac overload conditions during each training sessions. The cardiac muscle can be adapted in two ways: by volume overload, which happens in response to aerobic training and leads to an eccentric hypertrophy; and by pressure overload, in response to strengh/isometric training, leading to a concentric hypertrophy. This review focuses on the CH induced by physical training and its main intracellular signaling pathways that are involved in the change of the heart's phenotype. The intracellular mechanism of CH shows pathways dependent of IGF1 receptors that activate PI3-K and Akt induced by aerobic physical training and this pathway are not clear with straight physical training. Then, this is open area for investigation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=32197615&site=ehost-live"

Design: Randomized controlled trial. Subjects: Seventy-seven community-dwelling physically frail people over 75 years of age (mean = 81, SD = 4.5). Interventions: Home training (HT, N = 38) comprised twice daily functional balance and strength exercises and three group meetings. Combined training (CT, N = 39) included group training twice weekly and the same home exercises. Interventions lasted 12 weeks. Physiotherapists ran both programmes. Home exercises were recorded daily. Main measures: HRQoL was assessed by SF-36, and ambulatory capacity by walking speed and frequency and duration of outdoor walks. Results: Following intervention, CT improved the SF-36 mental health index significantly more than HT (p = 0.01). The SF-36 physical health index (p = 0.002) and walking speed (p = 0.02) demonstrated improvements, but no group differences. Six months after cessation of intervention there was still overall improvements on the mental health index (p = 0.032), borderline overall improvements on the physical health index (p = 0.057), higher weekly number of outdoor walks for the CT group than for the HT group (p = 0.027) and an improved habitual walking speed in the CT group only (p = 0.022). Conclusions: HT improved HRQoL and walking speed, but additional group training gave larger benefits on mental health. Group training away from home may be beneficial for mental health and ambulatory capacity.

Moreover, studies have shown that people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) present elevated concentration of homocysteine and oxidative stress compared with people without HIV. Our purpose was to describe blood homocysteine and oxidative stress markers in PLHIV and those without HIV infection, and to examine the effects of a 16-week combined training exercise program (CTE) on oxidative stress and homocysteine concentrations of PLHIV. We included 49 PLHIV (21 men, 28 women) and 33 people without HIV infection (13 men, 20 women). After baseline evaluations, 30 PLHIV were randomized to either CTE (trained group, n = 18) or the control group (n = 12); CTE consisted of aerobic and strength exercise sessions during 16 weeks, 3 times a week. Plasma homocysteine, oxidative damage markers, folate, and vitamin B12 were assessed pre- and post-training and by hyperhomocysteinemia (homocysteine ≥ 15 μmol/L) status. At baseline, PLHIV had higher levels of homocysteine and malondialdehyde, as well as reduced circulating folate when compared with people without HIV infection. CTE resulted in a 32% reduction (p < 0.05) in homocysteine concentration and a reduction in lipid hydroperoxide in PLHIV with hyperhomocysteinemia, which was not observed in those without hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemic participants experienced a 5.6 ± 3.2 μmol/L reduction in homocysteine after CTE. In summary, 16 weeks of CTE was able to decrease elevated homocysteine concentration and enhance redox balance of PLHIV with hyperhomocysteinemia, which could improve their cardiovascular risk.

Changes in testosterone, urine estrogens, T4 tyrosine and cortisol were compared in racers under training conditions of alternating middle altitude hypoxia and normoxia (group 1) and only normoxia (group 2). Materials and methods. 17 male ski-racers aged 18-23 years were involved in the study. The first group (1) consisted of cross-country skiers with a training process in the conditions of alternating middle altitude hypoxia (May-August- October) and normoxia (n = 7); the second group - ski-racers with the training process only in conditions of normoxia (n = 10). The study was conducted in the preparatory and competitive period (July and December). The cortisol content was determined using fluorometry with the help of Fluorat-02 ABLFT biofluid analyzer (Lumex, St. Petersburg, Russia) at a fluorescence excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission of 546 nm. At the same time, the object of laboratory research was heparinized blood taken from a cubital vein in the morning, on an empty stomach. The levels of total testosterone, urine estrogens, and T4 tyrosine were obtained with the help of a noninvasive AMP blood analyzer (Ukraine). Discriminant analysis was applied for statistical data processing as well as rank correlation analysis and nonparametric analysis of variance (William R. Kleck (1986). Results. It was found that in the 1st group of athletes there was an increase in total testosterone by 11.05% (p> 0.05), a decrease in urine estrogen and cortisol by 17.55% (p <0.05) and 29.91% (p <0.05), respectively. In the 2nd group, by the competitive period, we detected a decrease in testosterone by 6.41% (p> 0.05), urine estrogen by 3.49% (p> 0.05), tyrosine T4 by 0.18% (p> 0, 05) against the background of an increase in the concentration of cortisol by 25.85% (p <0.05). Conclusion. The study showed that people with a combined training process have a more successful competitive activity. The nature of the responses in the process of adaptation is determined by a decrease in catabolic and an increase in anabolic processes.

Hormonal contraceptive use does not affect strength, endurance, or body composition adaptations to combined strength and endurance training in women. J Strength Cond Res 35(2): 449-457, 2021-This study examined the effects of a 10-week period of high-intensity combined strength and endurance training on strength, endurance, body composition, and serum hormone concentrations in physically active women using hormonal contraceptives (HCs, n = 9) compared with those who had never used hormonal contraceptives (NHCs, n = 9). Training consisted of 2 strength training sessions and 2 high-intensity running interval sessions per week. Maximal bilateral isometric leg press (Isom), maximal bilateral dynamic leg press (one repetition maximum [1RM]), countermovement jump (CMJ), a 3,000-m running test (3,000 m), body composition, and serum hormone levels were measured before and after training between days 1-5 of each subject's menstrual cycle. Both groups increased 1RM and CMJ: HC = 13.2% (p < 0.001) and 9.6% (p < 0.05), and NHC = 8.3% (p < 0.01) and 8.5% (p < 0.001). Hormonal contraceptive improved 3,000 m by 3.5% (p < 0.05) and NHC by 1% (n.s.). Never used hormonal contraceptive increased lean mass by 2.1% (p < 0.001), whereas body fat percentage decreased from 23.9 ± 6.7 to 22.4 ± 6.0 (-6.0%, p < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in body composition in HC. No significant between-group differences were observed in any of the performance variables. Luteinizing hormone concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05) over 10 weeks in NHC, whereas other hormone levels remained statistically unaltered in both groups. It seems that the present training is equally appropriate for improving strength, endurance, and body composition in women using HC as those not using HC without disrupting hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis function.

In this review we present a mathematical model to estimate the possible year when a male could break through the sub-2-hour barrier, and also an estimation of when a female could break Paula Radcliffe’s marathon running record. Further, we present several aspects (ie, physiology, nationality, age, biomechanics, pacing, and drafting) that are associated with marathon running performance in elite runners and, finally, the possible characteristics of the male to break the sub-2-hour barrier. In summary, with the results of the developed equations, it is possible that a male athlete can break through the sub-2-hour barrier in the next decade (with Nike® Breaking2 performance 1920–2018 [NBP]: y =0.0417x2–14.18x +3,128; year of 2026; without NBP 1920–2018: y =0.045x2–15.12x +3,194; year of 2027). This marathoner will possibly have a maximal oxygen uptake >85 mL∙kg–1∙min–1 and should perform the race at a pacing higher than 85% of maximal oxygen uptake. In addition, this runner should pay more attention to strength training, endurance strength, speed training, and focus on running training at an intensity above the anaerobic threshold. Most likely, this runner originates from East Africa (especially from Ethiopia) and will have an age of ~27 years. For the females, there is poor evidence regarding the physiological profile of the female marathoner who will break Radcliffe’s record, but the available literature suggests that it will not happen any time soon.

Adaptations have been mostly investigated in muscle fibers after heavy-resistance and endurance training. In strength training the rapid improvement is due to poorly understood neural factors, with muscle fiber hypertrophy occurring rather later; fiber hyperplasia is probably unimportant. In contrast to other mammals, muscle fibers in humans do not readily change from ""slow"" to ""fast"" and vice versa, although there may be a period of plasticity in infancy especially responsive to weightbearing. A proportion of the changes in the fibers, following training, is probably brought about by stretch-activated mechanisms, in which second messengers express immediate early genes and the latter, in turn, promote the transcription of ""muscle"" genes; other cellular adaptations occur at the level of mRNA translation. In the spinal cord, adaptations following hemiparesis include a loss of functioning motor units. Impaired motor drive occurs not only in organic brain lesions but also after periods of disuse. In persons with amputations, the peripheral nerve stump undergoes degenerative changes; somatosensory cortical evoked responses, following stimulation of the stump, are diminished. It is possible that both sensory and motor cortical representations are increased for neighboring regions of the body.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH366496&site=ehost-live"

Design Longitudinal before–after trial of 6 months of FES row training. Setting Exercise for persons with disabilities program in a hospitaL. Participants Volunteers (N=14; age range, 21–63y) with complete spinal cord injury (SCI) (T3-11) who are >2 years postinjury. Intervention Six months of FES row training preceded by a variable period of FES strength training. Main Outcome Measures Peak aerobic capacity and peak exercise ventilation before and after 6 months of FES row training. Results FES row training significantly increased peak aerobic capacity and peak minute ventilation (both P <.05). Prior to FES row training, there was a close relation between level of SCI and peak aerobic capacity (adjusted R 2 =.40, P =.009) that was markedly reduced after FES row training (adjusted R 2 =.15, P =.10). In contrast, the relation between level of injury and peak minute ventilation was comparable before and after FES row training (adjusted R 2 =.38 vs .32, both P <.05). Conclusions The increased aerobic capacity reflects more than increased ventilation; FES row training effectively circumvents the effect of SCI on peak aerobic capacity by engaging more muscle mass for training, independent of the level of injury.

While anabolic in rodents, no study has been able to detect hypertrophy in humans after chronic beta2‐agonist inhalation. We investigated whether inhaled beta2‐agonist, terbutaline, alters body composition and metabolic rate with and without concurrent exercise training in healthy young men. Sixty‐seven participants completed a 4‐week intervention of daily terbutaline (8 × 0.5 mg) or placebo treatment without concurrent training (habitual; n = 23), with resistance (n = 23) or endurance (n = 21) training 3 times weekly. Before and after the interventions, participant's body composition was determined by dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry and resting metabolic rate and substrate oxidation by indirect calorimetry. Terbutaline increased lean body mass by 1.03 kg (95% CI 0.29‐1.76; P < .05) and 1.04 kg (95% CI 0.16‐1.93; P < .05) compared to placebo in the habitual and resistance training group, respectively, but had no effect compared to placebo in the endurance training group [−0.56 kg (95% CI −1.74‐0.62; P > .05)]. Fat mass, bone mineral content, and resting metabolic rate did not change differently between treatments with the intervention. Daily inhalation of terbutaline in near‐therapeutic doses induces skeletal muscle growth. This observation should be a concern for antidoping authorities.

This study evaluated the influence of concurrent strength and high-intensity aerobic sequence of exercise order between sessions on strength performance, metabolic, and inflammatory response. Eleven recreational weightlifters underwent the following 2 randomized sessions: (a) strength-aerobic exercise order (SA) and (b) aerobic-strength exercise order (AS). Blood samples were collected before (Pre) and immediately after the first exercise (Post-1) and the second exercise (Post-2) of each session. The SA condition presented a higher number of repetitions (SA: 54 ± 15 vs. AS: 43 ± 12) and total volume (SA: 7,265 ± 2,323 vs. AS: 5,794 ± 1846 kg) than the AS condition (both p = 0.001). Glucose was higher in Pre when compared with post-1 in both orders (p ≤ 0.05); changes in lactate were time-dependent in the different orders (p ≤ 0.05); however, AS post-2 lactate was lower when compared with SA post-2 (p ≤ 0.05). Interleukin-6 levels showed time-dependent changes for both exercise orders (p ≤ 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) level was increased only in AS post-1 (AS: pre = 21.91 ± 35.47, post-1 = 26.99 ± 47.69 pg·m-1 vs. SA: pre = 25.74 ± 43.64, post-1 = 29.74 ± 46.05 pg·ml-1, p ≤ 0.05). These results suggest that concurrent training order exhibits different immunometabolic responses and, at least in part, can be associated with the acute decline in strength performance induced by concurrent exercise. Our results point to a possible role of TNF-α (post-1 AS condition) as a trigger to restore the energy demand by providing substrates to help maintain contractile activity in skeletal muscle.

Because this was never investigated in multiple sclerosis, the present pilot study explored the impact of this training on cardiovascular risk factors in this population. Methods: Before and after 12 weeks of high-intense concurrent training (interval and strength training, 5 sessions per 2 weeks, n = 16) body composition, resting blood pressure and heart rate, 2-h oral glucose tolerance (insulin sensitivity, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood glucose and insulin concentrations), blood lipids (high- and low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglyceride levels) and C-reactive protein were analyzed. Results: Twelve weeks of high-intense concurrent training significantly improved resting heart rate (−6%), 2-h blood glucose concentrations (−13%) and insulin sensitivity (−24%). Blood pressure, body composition, blood lipids and C-reactive protein did not seem to be affected. Conclusions: Under the conditions of this pilot study, 12 weeks of concurrent high-intense interval and strength training improved resting heart rate, 2-h glucose and insulin sensitivity in multiple sclerosis but did not affect blood C-reactive protein levels, blood pressure, body composition and blood lipid profiles. Further, larger and controlled research investigating the effects of high-intense concurrent training on cardiovascular risk factors in multiple sclerosis is warranted. Implications for rehabilitation: High-intensity concurrent training improves cardiovascular fitness. This pilot study explores the impact of this training on cardiovascular risk factors in multiple sclerosis. Despite the lack of a control group, high-intense concurrent training does not seem to improve cardiovascular risk factors in multiple sclerosis.

Purpose The purpose of this review was to identify different types of physical training programs (aerobic, resistance, or combined), with or without counseling/diet modifications, and their impact on physical fitness in individuals who have class II and III obesity. Data Sources Medline and Medline In-Process, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, LILACS, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, and PubMed were searched up to June 2017. Study Selection This review had the following inclusion criteria: body mass index of ≥35 kg/m2 and age 18 years or older; supervised physical training program; randomized controlled trial; physical fitness outcome (muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and/or flexibility); in English or Portuguese; and available full-text article. Data Extraction Three reviewers independently extracted data, assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane tool, and discussed disagreements until consensus was reached. Data Synthesis Of the 9460 identified articles, 26 were included and 8 were used in a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed improvements in walking speed and maximal oxygen uptake but not knee extension strength in the intervention groups. The Cochrane risk-of-bias score indicated that the majority of the data were from randomized controlled trials with a low or unclear risk of bias. Limitations The large variability of outcomes and interventions made comparisons difficult. Conclusions A combination of aerobic exercise and resistance exercise, in addition to diet modifications, may improve cardiovascular and muscular endurance in individuals with class II and III obesity. However, conclusions must be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity in interventions and outcome measures among the studies and an unclear risk of bias in several studies.

In addition, a training-induced change in the relationship between muscular strength and endurance was assessed by testing changes in the accuracy of using endurance repetitions to predict 1 repetition maximum (1RM) bench press before and after training. College-aged men (n = 85) and women (n = 62) completed a 12-week linear periodization resistance training program. Before and after training, the subjects were assessed for 1RM and repetitions to fatigue (RTFs) with a submaximal load. After pretraining 1RM determination, the subjects were randomly assigned to perform RTFs at 65% 1RM (n = 74) or 90% 1RM (n = 73). Pretraining and posttraining RTFs were conducted at the same respective %1RM. Work capacity was determined from repetition weight × RTF. After training, there was a significant increase in 1RM in both men (~14%) and women (~23%). Posttraining RTF was not different from pretraining RTF at 65 %1RM (18.2 ± 5.1 and 19.0 ± 6.0, respectively) but was significantly reduced in the 90% 1RM group (6.1 ± 3.6 vs. 4.5 ± 2.7, respectively). Likewise, there was a differential effect of training on the expression of work capacity, which increased in the 65 %1RM group (123 ± 155 kg-reps) but decreased in the 90% 1RM group (-62 ± 208 kg-reps); the effect was independent of gender within each testing group. In conclusion, the changes in muscular strength associated with resistance training produced an increase in work capacity when tested with a 65 %1RM load without a change in endurance. In contrast, both work capacity and endurance decreased when tested with 90% 1RM. Thus, the impact of strength training on work capacity and muscle endurance is specific to the load at which endurance testing is performed.

From a concurrent training standpoint, such carry-over effects of fatigue from a resistance training session may impair the quality of a subsequent endurance training session for several hours to days with inadequate recovery. The proposed mechanisms of this phenomenon include: (1) impaired neural recruitment patterns; (2) reduced movement efficiency due to alteration in kinematics during endurance exercise and increased energy expenditure; (3) increased muscle soreness; and (4) reduced muscle glycogen. If endurance training quality is consistently compromised during the course of a specific concurrent training program, optimal endurance development may be limited. Whilst the link between acute responses of training and subsequent training adaptation has not been fully established, there is some evidence suggesting that cumulative effects of fatigue may contribute to limiting optimal endurance development. Thus, the current review will (1) explore cross-sectional studies that have reported impaired endurance performance following a single, or multiple bouts, of resistance training; (2) identify the potential impact of fatigue on chronic endurance development; (3) describe the implications of fatigue on the quality of endurance training sessions during concurrent training, and (4) explain the mechanisms contributing to resistance training-induced attenuation on endurance performance from neurological, biomechanical and metabolic standpoints. Increasing the awareness of resistance training-induced fatigue may encourage coaches to consider modulating concurrent training variables (e.g., order of training mode, between-mode recovery period, training intensity, etc.) to limit the carry-over effects of fatigue from resistance to endurance training sessions.

In swimming, as well as in other sports, aerobic endurance is one of the most important components of the physical fitness of swimmers, while VO2max represents the most objective measure for its assessment. VO2max refers to the maximum amount of oxygen that an individual can utilize during a one-minute exercise. Measurement of VO2max in swimming can be done in three ways, always using a method which is most similar to the swimming conditions during training and competitions. VO2max can be expressed in absolute and relative values, and in the case of elite swimmers ranges from 66 to 80 ml O2/kg/min. According to VO2max values, the work intensity in swimming can be optimized through exercise heart rate and subjective feelings of fatigue. Apart from VO2max, it is very important to measure the percentage of maximal oxygen uptake (%VO2max), which is the highest level of performance that an athlete can maintain over a longer period of time without becoming fatigued. In order to develop and increase VO2max, as well as other factors that influence the development of aerobic or cardio-respiratory endurance, it is advisable to take advantage of endurance training. This type of training can be divided into three levels: basic endurance training, anaerobic threshold endurance training and training above the anaerobic threshold. All three types of training influence the development of resistance, but it is considered that training at the anaerobic threshold is the most significant. Adaptations to training that increase maximum oxygen consumption can be divided into two groups; the first group increases the amount of oxygen that is supplied to the muscles, while the other increases oxygen utilization by the muscles. The latest studies presented in this paper indicate that the prediction of the results and success in swimming, according to the values of maximal oxygen uptake and the impact of training will always be current in swimming. A single component of success in swimming is rarely the subject of research, in most cases it is usually an entire group of them. Therefore, the aim is to find and develop those factors (characteristics and capabilities) which contribute to the sport results of swimmers.

In a randomized controlled trial, 45 participants (26 women) with low fitness were randomly assigned (2:1-ratio) to a training group (TG, n = 30) or inactive control group (CG, n = 15). TG had 15 weeks with one weekly 90-min supervised group-based session in a recreational sports club with combined aerobic exercise and strength training and were encouraged to perform home-based training 30 min/wk. Evaluations of relative VO2max (mLO2/min/kg), blood pressure, resting heart rate (HR), echocardiography, peripheral arterial tonometry, body composition, lipid profile and HbA1c were performed at 0 and 15 wks. Average HR during supervised training was 113 ± 13 bpm (68.6 ± 7.0%HRmax), with 4.3 ± 6.6% spent >90%HRmax. At 15-wk follow-up, intention-to-treat analyses revealed no between-group difference for VO2max/kg (0.4 mLO2/min/kg, 95%CI −0.8–1.5, P = 0.519; −3 mL/min, 95%CI −123–118, P = 0.966) or other cardiovascular outcomes (all P > 0.05). Compared to CG, total fat mass (−1.9 kg; 95%CI −3.2 to −0.5, P = 0.005), total fat percentage (−1.3%, 95%CI −2.2 to −0.3, P = 0.01) and total/HDL cholesterol ratio (P = 0.032) decreased in TG. Regular adherence to supervised training was high (81%), but 0% for home-based exercise. In conclusion, the group-based supervised training was associated with high adherence and moderate exercise intensity, whereas insufficiently supported home-based training was not feasible. Together, 15 wks of combined exercise training did not improve aerobic fitness or affected cardiovascular function in 50–70-yr-olds with low aerobic fitness, whereas some positive effects were observed in metabolic parameters. Highlights Combined exercise training implemented in a sports club elicited moderate aerobic intensity in 50-70-year-old untrained individuals. Supervised group-based training had high adherence whereas unsupported home-based training had very low adherence. 15 weeks of low-frequency combined moderate intensity exercise training improved lipid profile and fat mass, but had no effect on cardiovascular fitness.

Squat, deadlift, bench row, and bench press 1RM and V ˙ O 2 max rowing-ergometer ramp tests were completed. Overall recovery and overall stress were monitored every evening using the Short Recovery and Stress Scale. Results: Large and significant group × time interactions (P <.03, η p 2 >.23 , standard mean differences [SMD] > 0.65) in favor of VL10 (averaged +18.0% [11.3%]) were observed for squat, bench row, and bench press 1RM compared with TRF (averaged +8.0% [2.9%]). V ˙ O 2 max revealed no interaction effects (P =.55, η p 2 =.01 , standard mean difference <.23) but large time effects (P <.05, η p 2 >.27). Significant group × time interactions (P =.001, η p 2 >.54 , SMD > |0.525|) in favor of VL10 were also observed for overall recovery and overall stress 24 and 48 hours after strength training. Conclusions: VL10 serves as a promising means to improve strength capacity at lower repetitions and stress levels in highly trained athletes. Future research should investigate the interference effects of VL10 in strength endurance sports and its effects when increasing weekly VL10 sessions within one macrocycle.

After two months, the control group showed no alteration in physiological and cognitive variables. After the training period, the results showed a significant improvement in VO2max (F = 4.45, DF = 1, p &lt; 0.05) of 12 % and 11 % in aerobic training and combined aerobic and mental training groups, respectively. Logical memory (F = 4.31, DF = 1, p &lt; 0.05), as well as paired associates learning scores (F = 5.47, DF = 1, p &lt; 0.05) and memory quotient (F = 6.52, DF = 1, p &lt; 0.01) were significantly improved in the three trained groups. The mean difference in memory quotient between pre and post training was significantly higher in the combined aerobic and mental training group compared to aerobic training or mental training groups (F = 11.60, DF = 3, p &lt; 0.001). We conclude that the specific aerobic training and mental training used in this study could induce the same degree of improvement in cognitive function and that combined training seemed to lead to greater effects than either technique alone.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-847889&site=ehost-live"

In total, 96 hyperglycemic adult women (mean age 46 years [95% confidence interval; 38, 53]) were divided in four groups: Mapuche CT (Map‐CT, n = 14) or control group (Map‐CG, n = 44), and European CT (Eur‐CT, n = 14) or control group (Eur‐CG, n = 23). The following endpoints were analyzed at baseline and after 12 weeks: anthropometric (body mass, body mass index, waist circumference), body composition (fat mass, muscle mass, lean mass), cardiovascular (systolic [SBP]/diastolic [DBP] blood pressure), metabolic (blood fasting glucose and total cholesterol), and muscle strength (handgrip of dominant/non‐dominant arm). There were significant positive changes in body mass, body fat, and muscle mass (P < 0.0001) in both Map‐CT and Eur‐CT groups, whereas waist circumference was decreased significantly only in the Eur‐CT group (P < 0.0001). Both Map‐CT and Eur‐CT groups showed decreased levels of fasting glucose (P < 0.05) and total cholesterol after the intervention (P < 0.0001). Also, both Map‐CT (P < 0.05) and Eur‐CT (P = 0.01) groups showed a lowered SBP. Finally, significant increases were observed after training in handgrip strength (dominant arm) in Map‐CT and Eur‐CT groups (both P < 0.0001). CT led to similar improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors for metabolic syndrome development in Mapuche and European participants, with additional improvements in other anthropometric, body composition, cardiovascular, metabolic, and muscle strength parameters related to the prevention of metabolic syndrome. These results suggest future more complex studies. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=136269974&site=ehost-live"

Methods: In addition to their normal training program, players performed either S/A (n = 7) or SIT (n = 7) training for 4 wk. Speed/agility sessions consisted of 3 to 4 series of 4 to 6 exercises (eg, agility drills, standing start and very short sprints, all of <5 s duration); each repetition and series was interspersed with 30 s and 3 min of passive recovery, respectively. Sprint interval training consisted of 3 to 5 repetitions of 30-s all-out shuttle sprints over 40 m, interspersed with 2 min of passive recovery. Pre- and posttests included a countermovement jump (CMJ), 10-m sprint (10m), RSA test and a graded intermittent aerobic test (30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test, VIFT). Results: S/A training produced a very likely greater improvement in 10-m sprint (+4.6%, 90% CL 1.2 to 7.8), best (+2.7%, 90% CL 0.1 to 5.2) and mean (+2.2%, 90% CL -0.2 to 4.5) RSA times than SIT (all effect sizes [ES] greater than 0.79). In contrast, SIT resulted in an almost certain greater improvement in VIFT compared with S/A (+5.2%, 90% CL 3.5 to 6.9, with ES = -0.83). Conclusion: In well-trained handball players, 4 wk of SIT is likely to have a moderate impact on intermittent endurance capacity only, whereas S/A training is likely to improve acceleration and repeated sprint performance.

A single-case experimental design with baseline, intervention, and post intervention phases was conducted using a changing criterion design within a self-management program. Discrete exercise training and combined training methods were trialled, with the effects of both on actual rock climbing compared. All discrete exercises improved over baseline; Powerball grip 45%, open-handed pull-ups by 50% and multi-stage fitness 35%. There was, however, no observable improvement in climbing performance. In contrast combined training led to a 40% improvement in climbing performance. For amateurs wishing to improve their recreational indoor rock climbing ability, practicing the task holistically rather than by training discrete skills in isolation may prove to be more effective.

Endurance training was done at the same frequency on a cycle ergometer with a work load close to the subjects' peak cycle-ergometer 02 uptake (peak CE V02). Tests were performed pre- and post-training and for groups C and E at 14-day intervals as well.

The aim ofthis study was to investigate in physically inactive and overweight people if 2 weeks of HSFAD leads to hyperlipemia or insulin resistance and if concurrent aerobic exercise training counteracts those effects. Fourteen overweight (body mass index, 27.5 ±0.6 kg⋅m-2), healthy, young individuals (aged 24.8 ± 1.8 years) were randomly assigned to a diet (D) or a diet plus exercise (D + E) group. During 14 consecutive days both groups increased dietary saturated fatty acids from 31 ± 10 to 52 ± 14 g⋅day-1 (p < 0.001) while maintaining total fat intake. Concurrent to the diet, the D + E group underwent 11 cycle-ergometer sessions of 55 min at 60% peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Before and after intervention, insulin sensitivity and body composition were estimated, and blood lipids, resting blood pressure, and VO2peak were measured. Body weight and composition, plasma free fatty acids composition and concentration, and insulin sensitivity remained unchanged in both groups. However, post-intervention total cholesterol (T<SUB>C</SUB>) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) increased above pre-intervention values in the D group (147 ± 8 to 161 ± 9 mg⋅dL-1, p = 0.018 and 71 ± 10 to 82 ± 10 mg⋅dL-1, p = 0.034, respectively). In contrast, in the D + E group, T<SUB>C</SUB> and LDL-C remained unchanged (153 ± 20 to 157 ± 24 mg⋅dL-1 and 71 ± 21 to 70 ± 25 mg⋅dL-1). Additionally, the D + E group lowered systolic blood pressure (6 ± 2 mm Hg, p = 0.029) and increased VO2peak (6 ± 2 mL⋅kg-1⋅min-1, p = 0.020). Increases in T<SUB>C</SUB> and LDL-C concentration induced by 14 days of HSFAD can be prevented by concurrent aerobic exercise training, which, in addition, improves cardiorespiratory fitness.

Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) increased in the runners by 2.6 mL/kg/min, and body fat decreased with no change in body weight. Training did not alter plasma triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or total cholesterol, while high-density cholesterol (HDL-C) rose significantly, from 59 plus or minus 3 mg/dL to 76 plus or minus 4 mg/dL.

Increased trunk extension endurance is associated with meaningful improvement in balance among older adults with mobility problems. Objective: To determine whether trunk extension endurance changes with training are associated with clinically meaningful improvements in balance among mobility-limited older adults. Design: Longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient rehabilitation research center. Participants: Community-dwelling older adults (N=64; mean age, 75.9y) with mobility limitations as defined by a score of 4 to 10 on the Short Physical Performance Battery. Interventions: Sixteen weeks of progressive resistance training. Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes were the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the Unipedal Stance Time (UST). Predictors included leg strength, leg power, trunk extension endurance, and the product of heart rate and blood pressure (RPP) at the final stage of an exercise tolerance test. We performed an analysis of data from participants who completed 16 weeks of training by using binary outcomes defined by a clinically meaningful change (CMC) from baseline to completion of the intervention (BBS=4 units; UST=5s). The association of predictor variables with balance outcomes was examined separately and together in multivariate adjusted logistic regression models. Results: Trunk extension endurance in seconds (1.04 [1.00–1.09]) was independently associated with CMC on the BBS. Trunk extension endurance (1.02 [1.00–1.03]) was independently associated with CMC on the UST. Other physical attributes were not associated with meaningful change in balance. Conclusions: Improvements in trunk extension endurance were independently associated with CMCs in balance in older adults. Leg strength, leg power, and RPP were not associated with CMC in balance. Poor trunk extension endurance may be a rehabilitative impairment worthy of further study as a modifiable factor linked to balance among older adults.

Eighty boys were categorized into 2 maturity groups (pre- or post-peak height velocity [PHV]) and randomly assigned to a plyometric training, resistance training, combined training, or control group. Intervention groups participated in training twice weekly for 6 weeks, with measures of acceleration, maximal running velocity, squat jump height, and reactive strength index (RSI) collected preintervention and postintervention. In the pre-PHV cohort, plyometric training and combined training resulted in significantly more positive responders than the other 2 groups in both sprint variables (standardized residual values >1.96). In the post-PHV cohort, significantly more positive responders for acceleration and squat jump height resulted from traditional strength training and combined training groups, compared with other groups. Conversely, plyometric training and combined training resulted in a significantly greater number of positive responders than the other 2 groups for maximal velocity and RSI. Control participants rarely demonstrated meaningful changes in performance over the 6-week period. Irrespective of maturation, it would seem that combined training provides the greatest opportunity for most individuals to make short-term improvements in jump and sprint performance. Taking maturation into account, our data show that a plyometric training stimulus is important for individuals in the pre-PHV stage of development, whether as a standalone method or in combination with traditional strength training, when attempting to improve jumping and sprinting ability. However, individuals in the post-PHV stage require a more specific training stimulus depending on the performance variable that is being targeted for improvement.

Maximal aerobic power generation is also reduced. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of maximal power cycling (PC) training using an inertial load ergometer on skeletal muscle mass and cardiovascular function in untrained 50- to 68-yr-old participants. Methods: The study used a pre- or postoutcome exercise intervention testing untrained 50- to 68-yr-old adults (n = 39, M = 15, mean ± SE = 58.5 ± 0.8, range = 50–68 yr). Over the course of 8 wk, participants performed 15 min of training 3 times per week. Each session involved repeated (15–30 times) 4-s sprints of PC. Measurements were thigh muscle volume, total body lean mass, Pmax, peak oxygen consumption, cardio-ankle vascular index, performance on functional tests of living (FTLChair and FTLRamp), and intermuscular fat volume. Results: Training for 8 wk increased thigh muscle volume (3.7% ± 0.9%, P < 0.001) and total body lean mass (1.5% ± 0.4%, P < 0.01) while increasing total body mass (TBM) (1.4% ± 0.3%, P < 0.01). Physical performance measures increased significantly (all P < 0.05) with improvements in Pmax (12.0% ± 1.5%); peak oxygen consumption (9.8% ± 1.8%), and FTL (8.5% ± 1.3% to 17.2% ± 2%). Cardio-ankle vascular index was significantly decreased −2.3% ± 1.1% (P < 0.05), indicating reduced arterial stiffness. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that 8 wk of PC training at true maximal power was effective at increasing muscle mass and maximal power, as well as maximal cardiovascular capacity and functional tasks in untrained 50- to 68-yr-olds.

First, we evaluated whether 8-weeks of combined training (high-intensity intermittent plus strength training) may change brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and lipid parameters (triacylglycerol, HDL-c and non-HDL) in a fasted state. Second, we investigated the effect of an acute session of high-intensity intermittent exercise followed by strength training on systemic BDNF and lipid parameters preand post 8-weeks of training. Twenty-one healthy and physically active men were divided into two groups: high-intensity intermittent exercise combined with strength training (HSG; n = 11) and control (CG; n = 10). The HSG exercised for one minute at 100% of speedVO2max (sVO2max) interspersed with one minute of passive recovery followed by strength training (8 exercises with 8-12 repetition maximum loads) for 8-weeks. Heart rate variability, blood pressure, lipid profile, and BDNF concentrations were measured in the fasted state pre- and post-exercise and before and after the 8-week training period. After 8-weeks of exercise training, there was an increase in spectral high frequency component (ms2) and RR interval (p < 0.05), a decreased spectral low frequency component (nu) and heart rate values (p < 0.05), an increase in HDL-c (p < 0.001), and lower BDNF concentrations (p < 0.001). These results suggest that 8-weeks of high-intensity intermittent exercise combined with strength exercise is an effective protective cardio-metabolic strategy capable of increasing HDL-c and BDNF concentrations after an acute exercise session. In the long-term, the modulation on BDNF and HDL-c concentrations may be a determining factor for protection against neurological and cardiovascular diseases.

We investigated whether TAA concurrent exercise circuit induced postexercise hypotension (PEH) in individuals older than 60 years. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) after counterbalanced CEX and nonexercise (CONT) sessions (n = 16; 66.8 ± 1.4 years; systolic/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP): 132.5 ± 4.3/78.0 ± 2.8 mm Hg). For statistical analyses purposes, groups were divided as exhibiting normal SBP (≤120 mm Hg) or high SBP (>120 mm Hg), based on 24-hour ABPM after CONT. The CEX included 2 aerobic and 9 resistance exercises performed alternately in circuit order (40 minutes at 60–70% heart rate reserve using body mass or fixed loads). 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring lowered in individuals with high BP (n = 11; medicated = 5) (SBP: −6.5 ± 1.9 mm Hg; mean arterial pressure [MAP]: −4.3 ± 1.5 mm Hg; p < 0.015), particularly within the first 5–6 hours after exercise (SBP: −13.5 ± 2.6 mm Hg; DBP: −9.4 ± 2.2 mm Hg; and MAP: −11.4 ± 1.6 mm Hg, p < 0.05). Significant BP lowering was not detected among participants with normal BP (n = 5; medicated = 4). In conclusion, CEX provoked PEH in older adults with prehypertension to established hypertension. Because of the potential of TAAs to reach large numbers of older adults, our findings are encouraging and should be confirmed in subsequent studies.

However, 12 weeks of resistance exercise training (∼1 h total exercise time) in older individuals (60-78 years) induces quadriceps muscle hypertrophy (9%) without impacting patellar tendon size. The current study examined if a different loading paradigm using cycle exercise would promote patellar tendon hypertrophy or alter the internal tendon properties, measured with magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity, in older individuals. Nine women (70 ± 2 years) completed 12 weeks of aerobic upright cycle exercise training (∼28 h total exercise time). Aerobic exercise training increased ( P < 0.05) quadriceps muscle size (11 ± 2%) and VO2max (30 ± 9%). Mean patellar tendon cross-sectional area ( CSA) (2 ± 1%) and signal intensity (−1 ± 2%) were unchanged ( P > 0.05) over the 12 weeks of training. Region-specific CSA was unchanged ( P > 0.05) at the proximal (−1 ± 3%) and mid regions (2 ± 2%) of the tendon but tended ( P = 0.069) to increase at the distal region (5 ± 3%). Region-specific signal intensity differed along the tendon but was unchanged ( P > 0.05) with training. Although more studies are needed, exercise-induced patellar tendon hypertrophy, compared with skeletal muscle, appears to be attenuated in older individuals, while the loading pattern associated with aerobic exercise seems to have more impact than resistance exercise in promoting patellar tendon hypertrophy.

The control group continued their normal daily activities.Main measures: Before and after the intervention anthropometric variables (weight, length, BMI, body composition), metabolic control (glycaemia, HbA1c, daily insulin injected), aerobic capacity (peak Vo2, peak power, peak heart rate, 6-minute walk distance), strength (1 repetition maximum of upper and lower limb, hand grip strength, muscle fatigue resistance, sit-to-stand) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed.Results: At baseline, none of the measured parameters differed significantly between the two groups. There was no significant evolution in the groups concerning anthropometric indices, glycaemia and HbA1c. However, the daily doses of insulin injected were significantly lowered in the training group (0.96 IU/kg.day pre versus 0.90 IU/kg.day post; P<0,05), while it was increased in the control group. Physical fitness increased significantly in the training group.

Methods: Thirty-five overweight men were matched and randomly placed into either a control group (C; N=6) or one of three dietary groups; a diet-only group (D;N=8), a diet group that performed aerobic exercise three times per week (DE; N=11); and a diet group that performed both aerobic and strength training three times per week (DES;N=10). Results: After 12 wk, D, DE, and DES demonstrated a similar and significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) reduction in body mass (-9.64, -8.99, and -9.90 kg, respectively) with fat mass comprising 69, 78, and 97 % of the total loss in body mass, respectively. The diet-only group also demonstrated a significant reduction in fat-free mass. Maximum strength, as determined by 1-RM testing in the bench press and squat exercise was significantly increased for DES in both the bench press (+ 19.6 %) and squat exercise (+ 32.6 %). Absolute peak O2 consumption was significantly elevated in DE (+24.8 %) and DES (+15.4 %). There were no differences in performance during a 30-s Wingate test for the DE and DES, whereas D demonstrated a significant decline in peak and mean power output. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) (kcal.d-1) was not significantly different for any of the groups except for the DE group. There were no significant changes in basal concentrations of serum glucose, BUN, cortisol, testosterone, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol for any of the groups. Serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were significantly decreased for all dietary groups. Serum triglycerides were significantly reduced for D and DES at week 6 and remained lower at week 12 for D, while triglycerides returned to baseline values for DES. Conclusions: These data indicate that a weight-loss dietary regimen in conjunction with aerobic and resistance exercise prevents the normal decline in fat-free mass and muscular power and augments body composition, maximal strength, and maximum oxygen consumption compared with weight-loss induced by diet alone.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-78977&site=ehost-live"

The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of short-term, high-intensity resistance training on the lipid profile of young men and women. The resistance training program was known to result in significant adaptations within the vastus lateralis muscle (39), which could contribute to alterations in lipid profile. Thirty-two college-aged individuals were divided into four groups: training men (n = 12), control men (n = 7), training women (n = 8), and control women (n = 5). The short-term (8-week) training period consisted of three exercises for the lower extremity (squats, leg press, and leg extension) performed two times a week for three sets to failure, performing 6-8 repetitions maximum (RM0 on Mondays and 8-10 RM on Fridays. After fasting, blood was drawn at three time points (pre-, mid, and posttraining) and analyzed for lipid and lipoprotein concentrations (total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides). Although the training program resulted in significant alterations in body composition (decrease in percent body fat) and fiber composition (hypertrophy and type IIB to IIA fiber conversions), no change was detected over time for any of the blood lipid parameters in either young men or young women. Thus, while any form of physical activity may prove beneficial for individuals at risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), short-term, high-intensity resistance training does not appear to influence serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in young individuals not at risk for CHD.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-164971&site=ehost-live"

Strength training, especially, plays a key role in this process. Sprint performance will be viewed multidimensionally as an initial acceleration phase (0 to 10m), a phase of maximum running speed (36 to 100m) and a transition phase in between. Immediately following the start action, the powerful extensions of the hip, knee and ankle joints are the main accelerators of body mass. However, the hamstrings, the m. adductor magnus and the m. gluteus maximus are considered to make the most important contribution in producing the highest levels of speed. Different training methods are proposed to improve the power output of these muscles. Some of them aim for hypertrophy and others for specific adaptations of the nervous system. This includes general (hypertrophy and neuronal activation), velocity specific (speed-strength) and movement specific (sprint associated exercises) strength training. In developing training strategies, the coach has to keep in mind that strength, power and speed are inherently related to one another, because they are all the output of the same functional systems. As heavy resistance training results in a fibre type IIb into fibre type IIa conversion, the coach has to aim for an optimal balance between sprint specific and nonspecific training components. To achieve this they must take into consideration the specific strength training demands of each individual, based on performance capacity in each specific phase of the sprint.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH436755&site=ehost-live"

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks of concurrent training on the fat profile, blood testosterone and cortisol response in young male wrestlers. Material/Methods: Twenty-four young male wrestlers voluntarily participated and were randomly assigned to three groups, namely: endurance training (ET, N=8), strength training (ST, N=8) and concurrent training (CT, N=8). The groups did their training programs three sessions per week. Results: The findings of this study showed that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased by 33.54% in the strength group (P=0.02). Total Testosterone (TT) experienced a decrease by 30.68% in the endurance group (P= 0.02) and by 41.55% in the concurrent group (P=0.02). Cortisol (cor) increased by 55.73% in the endurance (P=0.00) and by 41.55% in the concurrent (P=0.02) group, respectively. Testosterone- to-Cholesterol ratio (TT:Cor) decreased by 125.80% by and 78.12% in the endurance (P=0.00) and concurrent (0.04) groups, respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that the decrease in HDL, an increasing trend in TT in the strength training group and also a decrease in TT and an improved lipids profile in the endurance and concurrent training groups can be a function of the training type.

We hypothesized that a speed-full-squat training regimen could enhance squat strength and power with simultaneous improvements in short sprint performance. 122 physically active adults (age: 20.5±2.5years; body mass: 65.8±6.1 kg; height: 1.71 ±0.08m) were randomly divided into 4 groups: full squat training (n = 36), combined full squat and sprint training (n=32), speed training only (n = 34) and non-training control group (n = 20). Each training group completed 2 sessions per week over 6 weeks, while the control group performed only their normal physical activity. Sprint performance was improved after sprint running or full squat training alone (1.7% and 1.8% P<0.05, respectively), however larger enhancements (2.3 %; P < 0.01) were observed after the combined full squat plus sprint training intervention. These results suggest that in recreationally active adults, combined full squat and sprint training provides a greater stimulus for improving sprint performance than either modality alone.

Within endurance training, the principal topic is the efficacy of moderate continuous training and high-intensity interval training. However, the findings of these previous studies are controversial and a very high heterogeneity has been reported in previous meta-analyses. Despite the fact that the influence of the training variables, such as frequency, intensity, time and type (FITT variables) has been widely reported, none of the previous studies have considered these variables globally in order to explain the controversial results. Therefore, the aim of this review was to interpret previous studies to explain this heterogeneity and set out proposals to manage exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation properly. The review helped to show the lack of control of FITT variables and their influence in the effect of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, highlighting the need to control these variables properly to reach higher adaptations in cardiac rehabilitation.

Interventions including exercise training are frequently used to modify cardiovascular disease risk factors. Consequently, this project examined associations between the IL-6 -174 genotype and oral glucose tolerance test outcomes in 50- to 75-yr-old sedentary men and postmenopansal women before and after aerobic exercise training. Among the 87 individuals who started the study, 56 were retested after 6 mo of aerobic exercise training. Subject characteristics at baseline did not differ between the IL-6 genotype groups with the exception of fasting glucose, which was higher (P = 0.02, covariates age, gender, and ethnicity) in the CC genotype group. The training-induced change in glucose area under the curve during the oral glucose tolerance test varied between the IL-6 -174 genotype groups (P = 0.05, covariates age, gender, ethnicity, baseline glucose area under the curve, and percent body fat change) with a significant decrease occurring only in the GG genotype group. Insulin outcomes did not differ among the groups at baseline or after training. Training-induced changes in weight, percent body fat, maximal oxygen consumption, fasting glucose, and an insulin sensitivity index also changed similarly among the genotype groups. In conclusion, fasting glucose and the extent to which glucose tolerance changes with exercise training may be influenced by the IL-6 -174 gene polymorphism.

Altitude training is promising in increasing athletic performance, allowing acclimatization benefits, and improving aerobic capacity. Devices were developed to simulate this training and the Elevation Training Mask (ETM), which resists oxygen inlet and outlet, is aimed at increasing the Maximum Oxygen Volume (VO2 max), improving lung function. Objective: To evaluate the effect of ETM on cardiorespiratory parameters in aerobic exercise practitioners. Methodology: An aerobic training protocol was made, developed for eight weeks, with a duration of 120 minutes per week, divided into three days of 40 minutes, respecting the target heart rate delimited by the ergospirometry test. The initial four weeks of the protocol were performed without the use of the mask and the last four weeks with the mask. Cirtometry, ergospirometry, manovacuometry and echocardiography tests were performed before and after its use. Three individuals' practitioners of aerobic exercise between 35 and 39 years old participated. This project was submitted and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Planalto Catarinense University (UNIPLAC) under opinion n° 3,319,154. Results: There was an increase in peak VO2 and other respiratory variables after training with the mask, but without statistical significance. The Pimax had a statistical difference suggesting an increase of inspiratory strength. Conclusion: Through physiotherapy evaluation, the ETM provided improvement in the cardiorespiratory parameters in practitioners of aerobic exercises, where the greatest evidence was in the strengthening of the respiratory muscles, especially the inspiratory ones.

In the search for better results, High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) associated with ST has been widely practiced. However, little is known about its influence on performance capacity when both are practiced in the same exercise session. Objective: to evaluate the effect of the rest interval after a HIIT session on muscle strength. Methods: Eight young men (25.6 ± 6.1 years), bodybuilders for at least 6 months participated in the study. Two randomized protocols with 72h intervals were performed. In protocol 1, the HIIT was performed and then repeated the 10RM test. In protocol 2, the HIIT was performed, given a rest of 30 minutes, and then performed the 10RM test. A significance level of p<0.05 was established. Results: The performance in the 10RM test in the 45th Leg Press was significantly lower when performed without rest (7 ± 3 repetitions). There was no significant difference for the chest press even without rest. When there was rest between exercises, there were no differences in performance in 10RM in both the ches press and the Leg Press 45°. Conclusion: HIIT in treadmill promotes a decrease in strength performance in the lower limbs, and this influence can be attenuated with at least a 30-minute interval between training sessions.

It was evaluated the sexual maturation, body mass, height, body mass index (BMI), fat percentage (%BF), waist and hip circumference, flexibility and aerobic capacity (VO2max). Muscle strength was assessed by a maximal repetition test (1RM) of the upper limbs (Right Supine) and lower (Leg Press 45°). Intervention with resistance training at 75% of 1RM was performed for 8 weeks. For the analyzes, the difference (Δ) between the initial and final data (pre vs. post) of the dependent variables for each group and nonparametric Kruskall-Wallis analysis was obtained. The Sidak post hoc was performed to correct the level of significance of the multiple comparisons with a significance level set at p <0.05. No differences were found in the anthropometric variables and body composition. There were significant differences (p=0.001) for variables, flexibility, VO2max, upper limb musculature strength (FMMS) and lower limb musculature strength (FMMI) when analyzed The group as a whole after intervention. Among the maturational groups, significant differences (p=0.001) were found in flexibility and FMMII.

In the FMMII between the maturational stage 4 for the maturational stage 1 (p=0.03), and between the maturational stage 4 for the maturational stage 3 (p=0.04). It can be observed that, after the application of strength training, significant differences were detected in VO2max, FMMS and FMMI of handball athletes. When the results are dichotomized by the pubertal stage, significant improvements in flexibility and strength are observed, especially in adolescents in the pre- and post-pubertal stages.

Forty-nine of the original participants completed the training program. Walk/jog training increased VO2max from 22.5 to 27.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 (P less than or equal to 0.05) while STREN and CONT showed no change. STREN improved significantly in chest press and leg extension strength (P less than or equal to 0.05) while W/J and CONT showed no change. Adherence to training was 20/23 (87%) and 17/21 (81%) in STREN and W/J, respectively.

Well-trained cyclists completed either (1) usual endurance training supplemented with heavy strength training twice a week during a 12-week preparatory period followed by strength maintenance training once a week during the first 13 weeks of a competition period (E + S; n = 6 [♂ = 6]), or (2) usual endurance training during the whole intervention period (E; n = 6 [♂ = 5, ♀ = 1]). Following the preparatory period, E + S increased thigh muscle CSA and 1RM (p < 0.05), while no changes were observed in E. Both groups increased maximal oxygen consumption and mean power output in the 40-min all-out trial (p < 0.05). At 13 weeks into the competition period, E + S had preserved the increase in CSA and strength from the preparatory period. From the beginning of the preparatory period to 13 weeks into the competition period, E + S increased peak power output in the Wingate test, power output at 2 mmol l(-1) [la(-)], maximal aerobic power output (W (max)), and mean power output in the 40-min all-out trial (p < 0.05). The relative improvements in the last two measurements were larger than in E (p < 0.05). For E, W (max) and power output at 2 mmol l(-1) [la(-)] remained unchanged. In conclusion, in well-trained cyclists, strength maintenance training in a competition period preserved increases in thigh muscle CSA and leg strength attained in a preceding preparatory period and further improved cycling performance determinants and performance.

Seven collegiate distance runners (5 male/2 female; VO2max = 59.9 +/- 11.7 mL.kg-1.min-1) were recruited to participate in this study. Initial testing included maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), sustained maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (MIP), breathing endurance time (BET) at 60 % MIP, and endurance run time (ERT) at 85 % VO2max. Heart rate (HR), minute ventilation (VE), oxygen consumption (VO2), and ratings of perceived dyspnea (RPD) were recorded at 5-min intervals and during the last minute of the endurance run. Blood lactate concentration (BLC) was also obtained immediately before and at 2 min after the endurance run. All testing was repeated after 4 wk of IMT (50 -65 % MIP, approx. 25 min.d-1, 4-5 sessions/week, 4 wk). After 4 wk of IMT, MIP and BET were significantly increased compared with pretraining values (P &lt; 0.05). No significant differences between pre and post values were observed in VO2max or ERT at 85 % VO2max after IMT. No significant differences between pre and post values were detected in HR, VE, VO2, or RPD during the endurance run as measured at steady state and end of the test after IMT. BLC was not significantly different before or at 2 min after the endurance run between pre and post IMT. These results suggest that IMT significantly improves respiratory muscle strength and endurance. However, these improvements in respiratory muscle function are not transferable to VO2max or endurance exercise capacity as assessed at 85 % VO2max in competitive athletes.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-833947&site=ehost-live"

A need for other methods of hamstring strengthening are thus warranted with the main aim of reducing the risk of injury during the subsequent intense athletic activities. The study aimed to examine changes in hamstring strength in response to high velocity elastic band training when incorporated into regular training routine of football players. Methods. Research participants were professional top level football players (age 23.1 ± 5.7 years; weight 77.2 ± 7.7 kg, training experience 14.1 ± 5.8 years). In the pre-season, in addition to their routine training, the experimental group performed hamstring curls at maximal intensity while lying prone three times per week for five weeks, while control group continued their routine training. Concentric knee torque at 60°/s and 180°/s angular velocities, countermovement jump height, 30m sprint running performance from standing and flying start, and knee flexionextension movement frequency were measured before and after the 5 weeks of training. Results. Hamstring curl frequency during lying prone increase by 10.5 % (p < .05) in the experimental group and did not change in the control group. Peak torque for knee flexion and knee extension, jump height and sprint running performance did not change significantly in any group (p > .05). Conclusion. High velocity elastic band training incorporated into regular pre-season routine is beneficial for football players to increase their knee extension-flexion maximal movement frequency with no evident effects on strength, jump and sprint running performance. Results might be related with concurrent training during preparatory training phase of the pre-season when several physical capacities are being developed simultaneously.

Despite the potential additive benefits of combining these divergent exercise modes with regards to disease prevention and athletic performance, current evidence suggests that this approach may attenuate gains in muscle mass, strength, and power compared with undertaking resistance training alone. This has been variously described as the interference effect or concurrent training effect. In recent years, understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating training adaptation in skeletal muscle has emerged and provided potential mechanistic insight into the concurrent training effect. Although it appears that various molecular signaling responses induced in skeletal muscle by endurance exercise can inhibit pathways regulating protein synthesis and stimulate protein breakdown, human studies to date have not observed such molecular 'interference' following acute concurrent exercise that might explain compromised muscle hypertrophy following concurrent training. However, given the multitude of potential concurrent training variables and the limitations of existing evidence, the potential roles of individual training variables in acute and chronic interference are not fully elucidated. The present review explores current evidence for the molecular basis of the specificity of training adaptation and the concurrent interference phenomenon. Additionally, insights provided by molecular and performance-based concurrent training studies regarding the role of individual training variables (i.e., within-session exercise order, between-mode recovery, endurance training volume, intensity, and modality) in the concurrent interference effect are discussed, along with the limitations of our current understanding of this complex paradigm.

In 2000, a seminal theoretical model indicated that the interference effect should occur when high-intensity interval training (HIIT) (repeated bouts at 95–100% of the aerobic power) and RT (multiple sets at ~ 10 repetition maximum;10 RM) were performed in the same training routine. However, there was a paucity of data regarding the likelihood of other HIIT-based CT protocols to induce the interference effect at the time. Thus, based on current HIIT-based CT literature and HIIT nomenclature and framework, the present manuscript updates the theoretical model of the interference phenomenon previously proposed. We suggest that very intense HIIT protocols [i.e., resisted sprint training (RST), and sprint interval training (SIT)] can greatly minimize the odds of occurring the interference effect on muscle strength and mass. Thus, very intensive HIIT protocols should be implemented when performing CT to avoid the interference effect. Long and short HIIT-based CT protocols may induce the interference effect on muscle strength when HIIT bout is performed before RT with no rest interval between them.

A secondary aim was to report the training‐induced changes and the prevalence of non‐responders. Forty‐five insulin‐resistant adult women were randomly assigned to one of the following 4 groups: HIT (39.2 ± 9.5 years [y]; body mass index [BMI], 29.3 ± 3.3; n = 14), RT (33.9 ± 9.3 y; BMI, 29.4 ± 5.5; n = 8), CT (43.3 ± 8.1 y; BMI, 29.1 ± 2.9; n = 10), and a control group (CG, 40.1 ± 11.4 y; BMI, 28.3 ± 3.5; n = 13). Nine body composition, 3 cardiovascular, 3 metabolic, and 5 performance outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention. Considering all outcomes, the lowest number of total non‐responses for one or more variables was found in the RT group, followed by the CT and HIT groups. Individuals in the CG group were classified as non‐responders for almost all the variables. Moreover, there were several significant changes in body composition and metabolic parameters, including fasting glucose (HIT: −5.7, RT −5.1 mg/d), fasting insulin (HIT: −0.6, RT −0.6 μIU/mL), and HOMA‐IR (HIT: −0.3, RT −0.4), in addition to improvements in cardiovascular and performance parameters. Also, there were significant differences among groups in the prevalence of non‐responders for the variables where a non‐response was detected. Overall, the study suggests that independent of the mode of training including volume and frequency, RT has an important ability to reduce the prevalence of non‐response to improve the 20 outcomes of health and performance in insulin‐resistant adult women.

While there is evidence that concurrent training can attenuate resistance training-induced improvements in maximal strength and muscle hypertrophy, research findings are often equivocal, with some suggesting short-term concurrent training may instead further enhance muscle hypertrophy versus resistance training alone. These observations have questioned the validity of the purported 'interference effect' on muscle hypertrophy with concurrent versus single-mode resistance training. This article aims to highlight some methodological considerations when interpreting the concurrent training literature, and, in particular, the degree of changes in strength and muscle hypertrophy observed with concurrent versus single-mode resistance training. Individual training status clearly influences the relative magnitude and specificity of both training adaptation and post-exercise molecular responses in skeletal muscle. The training status of participants is therefore likely a key modulator of the degree of adaptation and interference seen with concurrent training interventions. The divergent magnitudes of strength gain versus muscle hypertrophy induced by resistance training also suggests most concurrent training studies are likely to observe more substantial changes in (and in turn, any potential interference to) strength compared with muscle hypertrophy. Both the specificity and sensitivity of measures used to assess training-induced changes in strength and muscle hypertrophy also likely influence the interpretation of concurrent training outcomes. Finally, the relative importance of any modulation of hypertrophic versus strength adaptation with concurrent training should be considered in context with the relevance of training-induced changes in these variables for enhancing athletic performance and/or functional capacity. Taken together, these observations suggest that aside from various training-related factors, additional non-training-related variables, including participant training status and the measures used to assess changes in strength and muscle hypertrophy, are important considerations when interpreting the outcomes of concurrent training interventions.

The findings have shown that a fast and short-lasting ACTH increase occurred at the beginning of all kinds of exercise, preceding the cortisol response. However, in several cases the cortisol response did not follow the rise of corticotropin level in blood, indicating the possibility of an endogenous inhibition of the adrenocortical response.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH360600&site=ehost-live"

Thirty-two participants were randomly assigned into one of the following groups: continuous running and resistance training (C-RUN, n = 10), interval running and resistance training (I-RUN, n = 11), or control group that performed resistance training only (RT, n = 11). Each group trained twice a week during 11 weeks. Oxygen uptake corresponding to the first ventilatory threshold (VO2VT1), second ventilatory threshold (VO2VT2) and maximal effort (VO2max) was measured in a maximal incremental test performed before and after training. Significant increases in VO2VT1, VO2VT2 and VO2max were observed in all training groups. VO2VT2 and VO2max presented time-group interactions, indicating that the magnitude of the increase in these variables was dependent on the training group (VO2VT2 : C-Run = 6.6%, I-Run = 15.7%, RT = 1.7%; VO2max : C-Run = 7.2%, I-Run = 14.3%, RT = 2.7%). The effect size observed for post-training values comparing C-RUN and RT groups was d = 0.566 for VO2VT2 and d = 0.442 for VO2max. On the other hand, values of d = 0.949 for VO2VT2 and d = 1.189 for VO2max were verified between I-RUN and RT groups. In conclusion, the use of continuous and interval aerobic exercise during concurrent training improved different cardiorespiratory parameters in women, but in a greater magnitude when interval aerobic exercise was performed simultaneously to resistance training.

However, the muscle biopsy procedure is invasive, and analyses are often expensive, which places pragmatic restraints on sample sizes. The unilateral exercise model can serve to increase statistical power and reduce the time and cost of a study. With this approach, 2 limbs of a participant are randomized to 1 of 2 treatments that can be applied almost concurrently or sequentially depending on the nature of the intervention. Similar to a typical repeated measures design, comparisons are made within participants, which increases statistical power by reducing the amount of between-person variability. A washout period is often unnecessary, reducing the time needed to complete the experiment and the influence of potential confounding variables such as habitual diet, activity, and sleep. Variations of the unilateral exercise model have been employed to investigate the influence of exercise, diet, and the interaction between the 2, on a wide range of variables including mitochondrial content, capillary density, and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Like any model, unilateral exercise has some limitations: it cannot be used to study variables that potentially transfer across limbs, and it is generally limited to exercises that can be performed in pairs of treatments. Where appropriate, however, the unilateral exercise model can yield robust, well-controlled investigations of skeletal muscle responses to a wide range of interventions and conditions including exercise, dietary manipulation, and disuse or immobilization.

Yet the combined influence of these exercise modalities, termed concurrent exercise training (CET), on resting BP is unclear. Purpose: This study aimed to meta-analyze the literature to determine the efficacy of CET as antihypertensive therapy. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for trials that included the following: adults (>19 yr), controlled CET interventions, and BP measured pre- and postintervention. Study quality was assessed with a modified Downs and Black Checklist. Analyses incorporated random-effects assumptions. Results: Sixty-eight trials yielded 76 interventions. Subjects (N = 4110) were middle- to older-age (55.8 ± 14.4 yr), were overweight (28.0 ± 3.6 kg⋅m-2), and had prehypertension (systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] = 134.6 ± 10.9/80.7 ± 7.5 mm Hg). CET was performed at moderate intensity (aerobic = 55% maximal oxygen consumption, resistance = 60% one-repetition maximum), 2.9 ± 0.7 d⋅wk-1 for 58.3 ± 20.1 min per session for 19.7 ± 17.8 wk. Studies were of moderate quality, satisfying 60.7% ± 9.4% of quality items. Overall, CET moderately reduced SBP (db = -0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.44 to -0.20, -3.2 mmHg) and DBP (db = -0.35,95% CI= -0.47 to -0.22, -2.5 mm Hg) versus control (P < 0.01). However, greater SBP/DBP reductions were observed among samples with hypertension in trials ofhigher study quality that also examined BP as the primary outcome (-9.2 mm Hg [95% CI = -12.0 to -8.0]/-7.7 mm Hg [95% CI = -14.0 to -8.0]). Conclusions: Among samples with hypertension in trials of higher study quality, CET rivals aerobic exercise training as antihypertensive therapy. Because of the moderate quality of this literature, additional randomized controlled CET trials that examine BP as a primary outcome among samples with hypertension are warranted to confirm our promising findings.

A total of 85 patients commencing outpatient cardiac rehabilitation at a major metropolitan hospital had their physical capacity assessed by an incremental shuttle walk test, and the initial aerobic exercise intensity and resistance training load prescribed were recorded. Physical capacity was lower in surgical patients than nonsurgical patients. While physical capacity was higher in younger compared with older surgical patients, there was no difference between younger and older nonsurgical patients. The initial exercise intensity did not differ between surgical and nonsurgical patients. This study highlights the importance of preprogram exercise testing to enable exercise prescription to be individualized according to actual physical capacity, rather than symptoms, comorbidities and age, in order to maximize the benefit of cardiac rehabilitation.

Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of combined training (HIIT / SIT + RT) with other exercise protocols on HRPF markers in adults. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE via PebMed, Cochrane-CENTRAL, SPORTDiscus, LILACS, SCIELO and Scopus databases between January and March 2017, using the following keywords in English and Portuguese: physical fitness, high-intensity interval training, sprint interval training, resistance training and adults. The quality of studies was evaluated using the PEDro scale. After applying both inclusion and exclusion criteria, nine articles were selected (n = 231). The extraction of means and standard deviations from studies was performed independently by two authors and the RevMan software was used to perform the meta-analysis. Combined training interventions lasted from 6 to 12 weeks and generated greater increase in maximal oxygen uptake than other forms of exercise. The combination of interval training and strength training may be considered more effective to improve aerobic capacity levels in adults.

Design: Randomized and prospective controlled trial. Methods: Thirty-two healthy untrained men, between 65 and 75 years of age, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control (C, n =12), endurance training (E, n =10), or concurrent training (ER, n =10). Training groups underwent 24weeks of exercise, 3 times a week. All participants were subjected to cardiopulmonary exercise testing and the 6-MWT, before and after the training period. Results: At follow-up, the E and ER groups had significantly higher peak oxygen uptake (15.0±9.1 and 12.6±10.4%, respectively) and 6-MWT distances (5.5±5.3 and 4.6±2.8%, respectively) compared to the C group. In pre-intervention (n =32), the 6-MWT distance correlated positively with (r =0.51, p =0.001) and at anaerobic threshold (r =0.39, p =0.010). On the other hand, there was no significant correlation between the changes (after–before) in the 6-MWT distance and peak (E and ER groups: r =0.38, p =0.097). Conclusions: The 6-MWT is not appropriate to evaluate changes in CRF in healthy elderly men who performed endurance and concurrent training for 24weeks.

Twenty-eight healthy postmenopausal women performed 10 weeks of combined exercise training associated with isoflavone (n = 16) or placebo (n = 12) supplementation. The RR intervals (RRi) were collected for 20 min using a heart rate monitor. Analysis of HRV was performed in time (mean squared difference of successive RRi (RMSSD), standard deviation of all normal RRi (SDNN), and percentage of adjacent RRi differing by more than 50 ms (pNN50)), frequency (low-frequency percentage (LF%), high-frequency percentage (HF%), and low-/high-frequency ratio (LF/HF)), and nonlinear domains (standard deviation of the instantaneous variability of the beat-to-beat interval (SD1), long-term variability of the continuous RRi (SD2), and their ratio (SD2/SD1)). Student's t test did not show differences between groups in any general baseline characteristic variables. The results of the generalized estimating equation tests did not demonstrate interaction or group effects for any HRV indices. However, the results reported time effects for mean RR (p < 0.001), RMSSD (p = 0.044), and SD1 (p = 0.044), with increases in these indices in response to exercise training. There were no time effects for LF%, HF%, LF/HF, SDNN, pNN50, SD2, or SD2/SD1. In conclusion, isoflavone supplementation did not promote additional effects on HRV indices of postmenopausal women subjected to 10 weeks of combined exercise training. Novelty Combined training improves heart rate variability in postmenopausal women. Isoflavone supplementation did not promote additional effects on heart rate variability in postmenopausal women.

Forty-one male Wistar rats were divided into: (a) sedentary sham; (b) resistance training sham; (c) combined exercise sham; (d) sedentary HF; (e) resistance training HF; and (f) combined exercise HF. Trained animals were subjected to a high-intensity RT protocol 3 times·wk-1, 75 to 85% of one repetition maximum (1RM) for 8 wks. Sham and HF trained groups showed the same responsiveness to muscle strength gain, improved functional capacity, as well as the attenuation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and collagen volume fraction (CVF) in the HF groups subjected to RT protocols. Total volume of sets and repetitions showed a close relationship with attenuated LVEDP and the volume of repetitions influenced the reduction of CVF in HF rats. Our results suggest that the isolated RT and combined training can play an important role in cardiac function in animals with HF and the magnitude of responses to muscular strength gains are similar between healthy and HF rats.

Jumping rope (JR) involves mainly foot muscles and joints, due to the quick rebounds, and it might be considered a type of plyometric training for improving power and stiffness, some of the key factors for endurance-running performance. Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of JR during the warm-up routine of amateur endurance runners on jumping performance, reactivity, arch stiffness, and 3-km time-trial performance. Methods: Athletes were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 51) or control (n = 45) group. Those from the control group were asked to maintain their training routines, while athletes from the experimental group had to modify their warm-up routines, including JR (2–4 sessions/wk, with a total time of 10–20 min/wk) for 10 weeks. Physical tests were performed before (pretest) and after (posttest) the intervention period and included jumping performance (countermovement-jump, squat-jump, and drop-jump tests), foot-arch stiffness, and 3-km time-trial performance. Reactive strength index (RSI) was calculated from a 30-cm drop jump. Results: The 2 × 2 analysis of variance showed significant pre–post differences in all dependent variables (P <.001) for the experimental group. No significant changes were reported in the control group (all P ≥.05). Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between Δ3-km time trial and ΔRSI (r = −.481; P <.001) and ΔStiffness (r = −.336; P <.01). The linear-regression analysis showed that Δ3-km time trial was associated with ΔRSI and ΔStiffness (R2 =.394; P <.001). Conclusions: Compared with a control warm-up routine prior to endurance-running training, 10 weeks (2–4 times/wk) of JR training, in place of 5 minutes of regular warm-up activities, was effective in improving 3-km time-trial performance, jumping ability, RSI, and arch stiffness in amateur endurance runners. Improvements in RSI and arch stiffness were associated with improvements in 3-km time-trial performance.

According to the physical fitness and the degree of osteoporosis of our participants we built homogenous training groups. They were trained under special regard of recent developments of physical sciences in particular the ""factors"" impacting bone strength described by Senn (30). To make our results transformable to the training praxis of ambulant exercise groups we strictly copied their exercise conditions. The exercise groups with different training frequencies (greater than 2-4 times/week, high frequency group vs. (1-maximum 2 times/week, low frequency group vs. non training control group) showed markedly different results. The high-frequency exercise group (n = 63) showed a highly significant increase of the BMD of the lumbar spine (plus 2.2 percent) and a significant increase of the mean lumbar vertebral width (plus 0.8 percent) as determined by DXA. Increases of the femoral neck BMD and total body calcium (DXA) were smaller (neck: plus 0.5 percent; ward: plus 0.9 percent; total body calcium: plus 0.6 percent) and statistically not significant. The low-frequency-exercise group (n=20) had less evident positive effects on all regions, while the non-training control group (n=25) showed a remarkable bone loss especially for the femoral neck region (-1.1 percent). There are significant differences between the high frequency exercise group and the control group concerning the percentage changes of the BMD at the lumbar spine (p is less than 0.001) and at wards triangle. For both exercise-groups we could demonstrate significant positive increases of all recorded parameters which are closely related to falls and fractures (endurance, isometric maximal strength, flexibility, reaction, orientation and balance) but also for quality of life parameters like wellness and pain-reduction. The degree of the positive effect seemed to be in a positive relationship to the training frequency. These results suggest that a training program under special regard of recent results of physical sciences even adjusted to frame conditions of an ambulant training program markedly influences osteoporotic risk factors concerning bone strength and falls and improves quality of life.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-17954&site=ehost-live"

Some studies have proposed a lactate threshold (LT) intensity as an optimal approach for concurrent training of cardiorespiratory endurance and muscle strength, as well as an alternative in resistance training. The objective of the present study was to analyze the results obtained in research evaluating the use of LT in resistance training. A keyword and search tree strategy identified 14 relevant articles in the Dialnet, Elsevier, Medline, Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Based on the studies analyzed, the conclusion was that the LT in resistance exercises can be determined either by mathematical methods or by visual inspection of graphical plots. Another possibility is to measure the intensity at which LT might coincide with the first ventilatory threshold (VT1). Since performing an exercise session at one's LT intensity has been shown to accelerate the cardiorespiratory response and induce neuromuscular fatigue, this intensity could be used to set the training load in a resistance training program.

Our review indicates that measurement of VO2 max, time to exhaustion, and the type of physical training program employed may influence endurance capacity on a cycle ergometer or treadmill or both. Heavy resistance training (80% of 1 RM) can induce shifts in myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms from type IIb (glycolytic) to type IIa (mixture-oxidative/non-oxidative) in trained peripheral muscle. The precise mechanisms causing these increases in aerobic capacity still remain unresolved in the literature. These peripheral adaptations may be attributed to concurrent heavy loaded-high volume (3 sets of 12 to 16 repetitions performed to volitional fatigue) leg resistance training and reduced volume aerobic loading. The mechanisms responsible for this change may be associated with the cross sectional area of the trained musculature. For example, if the cross sectional area of oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscle increases, even in the same percentages of the original muscle mass, then any work rate will represent a lesser percentage of that muscle's maximal capacity to complete both oxidative and non-oxidative work.

Thirty-four futsal players were divided into full squat group (SG, n = 12), combined full squat and change of direction exercises group (S+CDG, n = 12) and control group (CG, n = 10). The resistance training for SG consisted of full squat with low load (∼45-58% 1RM) and low volume (4-6 repetitions), whereas the S+CDG performed the same resistance training program combined with loaded change of direction. Sprint time in 10 and 20 m, change of direction test, countermovement vertical jump (CMJ) height, maximal strength and force-velocity relationship in full squat exercise, kicking speed ball (BS<Sub>mean</Sub> ) and repeated sprint ability (RSA<Sub>mean</Sub> ) were selected as testing variables. Both experimental groups showed significant improvements for CMJ, BS<Sub>mean</Sub> and all strength parameters. Only SG resulted in significant sprint gains, whereas S+CDG also achieved significant improvements in RSA<Sub>mean</Sub>.The CG remained unchanged after training period. No significant differences were found between both experimental groups. These findings suggest that only 12 sessions of either lightweight resistance training alone, lifting the load at maximal intended velocity or combined with change of direction exercises is enough to improve several physical and skills capacities critical to futsal performance in adult players.

Twenty eight sedentary women aged 20-35 years were randomly assigned to: control (CON) (n = 8), linear periodization (LP) (n = 10) and daily undulating periodization (DUP) (n = 10). LP and DUP models significantly improved body composition, maximal strength and ME. However, no significant changes were detected for cardiorespiratory fitness. LP showed a higher body fat loss ( - 12.73 %) compared to DUP ( - 9.93 %) ( p = 0.049), and systematically higher effect sizes (ES) when compared with DUP for maximal strength and cardiorespiratory fitness parameters (e. g. ES = 0.53 for ventilatory threshold). In contrast, DUP exhibited a significantly ( p = 0.002) greater ME gain (129.43 %) compared to LP (70.72 %) in bench press, and greater ES in all exercises. It may be suggested that LP performed with a high number of repetitions may be considered an appropriate periodization model for untrained young women that would likely lead to the improvement of body composition and maximum strength performance, whereas DUP is more effective for the development of ME.

Data were analysed to determine if there were differences between season phase (pre- and in-season), competition level, session type (combined training, court training, match, weights and conditioning) and year. Pre-season load (468.9 ± 183.2au) was higher than in-season load (431.3 ± 188.9au) (p <.05, ƞρ2 =.016).

Twenty-six subjects were randomly assigned into two groups (ISS: n=12; TR: n=14) and underwent an 8-week training regimen. Subjects in ISS underwent an additional loaded stretch for 30 s at 15% of their working load from the prior set during the inter-set rest periods. Muscle thickness of the pectoralis major at the belly (BMT) and lateral (LMT) portions, One-repetition maximum (1RM) and repetitions-to-failure (RTF) on the bench press exercise were measured at baseline and post 8 weeks of training. Additionally, volume load and perceptual parameters for exertion and recovery were measured. Both groups had similar total volume load and average perceptual parameters (p>0.05). There was a main time effect (p<0.01) for all but one dependent variable indicating that both groups responded similarly across time [(∆BMT: ISS=2.7±1.7 mm; TR = 3.0±2.2 mm), (∆LMT: ISS=3.2±1.6 mm; TR=2.8±1.7 mm, (∆1RM: ISS=6.6±3.8 kg; TR=7.5±5.7 kg). Repetitions-to-failure did not change in either group (∆RTF: ISS=0.0±2.1 repetitions; TR=0.0±2.3 repetitions, p>0.05).

Specifically, the theory postulates that heavy load training optimizes increases maximal strength, moderate load training optimizes increases muscle hypertrophy, and low-load training optimizes increases local muscular endurance. However, despite the widespread acceptance of this theory, current research fails to support some of its underlying presumptions. Based on the emerging evidence, we propose a new paradigm whereby muscular adaptations can be obtained, and in some cases optimized, across a wide spectrum of loading zones.

The VO2max and body composition of the subjects were examined at beginning, 1 year, 2 years (T2), and 3 years after (T3) training. Of the group, 19 subjects performed the weight lifting programme 5 days each week for 3 years (W-group), 4 subjects performed the same weight lifting programme for 3 years with an additional running programme consisting of 2 miles of jogging once a week during the 3rd year (R1-group), and 3 subjects performed the weight lifting programme during the 1st year and the same combined jogging and weight lifting programme as the R1-group during the 2nd and 3rd years (R2-group). The average VO2max relative to their body mass of the W-group decreased significantly during the 1st year, followed by an insignificant decrease in the 2nd year and a levelling off in the 3rd year. The average VO2max of the W-group at T2 and T3 was 44.2 and 44.1 ml.kg-1.min-1, respectively. The tendency of VO2max changes in the R1- and R2-groups was similar to the W-group until they started the jogging programme, after which they recovered significantly to the initial level within a year of including that programme, and they then levelled off during the next year. Lean body mass estimated from skinfold thicknesses had increased by about 8 percent after 3 years of weight lifting. The maximal muscle strength, defined by total olympic lifts (snatch, and clean and jerk), of these three groups increased significantly and there was no significant difference among the amounts of the increase in the three groups. These results suggested that high intensity weight training combined with jogging could be recommended for weight-trained athletes for developing optimal muscle strength without a concomitant reduction in VO2max.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH372199&site=ehost-live"

This study looks at long-term effects of an exercise intervention on maximal step-up height (MSH) in individuals with low physical function. Factors associated with changes in MSH was studied. Methods: Female patients (n = 101), mean (SD) age of 52 (11) years, were recruited for a 3-month group exercise intervention including 2–3 sessions/week of mixed aerobic fitness and strength training. MSH, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2-max), self-reported health (SF-36) and physical activity (PA) were measured at baseline (T0), after 3 months (T1) and after 14–30 (mean 22) months (T2). Relationships between changes in MSH (cm) and age, baseline MSH, time to follow-up, changes in anthropometric measurements, VO2-max, SF-36 and PA were studied with regression analyses. Results: MSH, significantly, increased from T0 to T1, 27.2 (5.7) to 29.0 (5.5) cm and decreased to 25.2 (5.5) cm at T2. Time to follow-up (B = − 0.42, p < 0.001) and change in BMI (B = − 0.29, p = 0.012) correlated significantly to changes in MSH. Waist circumference, VO2-max, PF and exercise/physical activity levels were significantly improved at T2, while BMI did not change. In a univariate logistic regression model, maintenance of MSH correlated to the extent of mixed training (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.25–8.89). In a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for important factors the correlation was not significant. However, MSH was significantly higher in individuals participating in 2–3 session per week compared to one session. Conclusions: A 3-month group exercise intervention increased MSH, improved fitness, decreased risk in female patients with elevated cardio-metabolic risk. After an average of 22 months MSH was reduced while positive effects remained for waist circumference, VO2-max, physical function and physical activity. However, regular group exercise 2–3 times per week with mixed aerobic fitness and strength training was associated with maintenance of MSH in a subgroup of patients.

A total of 57 participants were randomized into the following groups: (a) aerobic training (AT), (b) concurrent training in which resistance training progresses to the use of resistive equipment (CTRE), and (c) concurrent training in which resistance training progresses to multiple sets (CTMS). The participants trained twice a week for 16 weeks. Systolic BP decreased from pretraining to after 8 weeks of training and, subsequently, to after 16 weeks of training (AT: −6.53 mmHg, CTRE: −10.45 mmHg, and CTMS: −10.73 mmHg). Diastolic BP decreased from pretraining to after 8 and 16 weeks of training (AT: −6.23 mmHg, CTRE: −4.61 mmHg, and CTMS: −6.19 mmHg). Furthermore, 16% of the AT participants, 23% of the CTRE participants, and 28.5% of the CTMS participants were no longer classified as hypertensive. Water-based aerobic and concurrent training are efficient nonpharmacological measures to reduce BP in older women.

"Low intensity blood flow restriction training: a meta-analysis.","Loenneke, Jeremy; Wilson, Jacob; Marín, Pedro; Zourdos, Michael; Bemben, Michael","European Journal of Applied Physiology",="14396319",,="20120501","112","5","1849","11","74188143",,,"Article","BLOOD flow; PHYSICAL fitness -- Research; HYPERTROPHY; ARTERIAL occlusions; PHYSIOLOGY; META-analysis; HEALTH outcome assessment",,"The primary objective of this investigation was to quantitatively identify which training variables result in the greatest strength and hypertrophy outcomes with lower body low intensity training with blood flow restriction (LI-BFR). Searches were performed for published studies with certain criteria. First, the primary focus of the study must have compared the effects of low intensity endurance or resistance training alone to low intensity exercise with some form of blood flow restriction. Second, subject populations had to have similar baseline characteristics so that valid outcome measures could be made. Finally, outcome measures had to include at least one measure of muscle hypertrophy. All studies included in the analysis utilized MRI except for two which reported changes via ultrasound. The mean overall effect size (ES) for muscle strength for LI-BFR was 0.58 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.76], and 0.00 [95% CI: −0.18, 0.17] for low intensity training. The mean overall ES for muscle hypertrophy for LI-BFR training was 0.39 [95% CI: 0.35, 0.43], and −0.01 [95% CI: −0.05, 0.03] for low intensity training. Blood flow restriction resulted in significantly greater gains in strength and hypertrophy when performed with resistance training than with walking. In addition, performing LI-BFR 2-3 days per week resulted in the greatest ES compared to 4-5 days per week. Significant correlations were found between ES for strength development and weeks of duration, but not for muscle hypertrophy. This meta-analysis provides insight into the impact of different variables on muscular strength and hypertrophy to LI-BFR training.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of 10 weeks of once-daily energy drink consumption or energy drink consumption with exercise on measures of body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, mood, and safety in previously sedentary males. Thirty-eight males were randomly assigned to energy drink + exercise (EX-A), energy drink (NEX-A), placebo + exercise (EX-B), or placebo (NEX-B). All participants consumed 1 drink per day for 10 weeks; EX-A and EX-B participated in 10 weeks of resistance and endurance exercise. Testing was performed before (PRE) and after (POST) the 10-week intervention. No significant (p > 0.05) changes were observed for body composition, fitness, or strength in NEX-A; however, significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO2peak were observed in EX-A versus EX-B. Ventilatory threshold (VT), minute ventilation, VO2 at VT, and power output at VT improved significantly PRE to POST in EX-A but not in EX-B or nonexercising groups. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and immune function, as determined by PRE and POST blood work revealed no adverse effects in response to the energy drink. Mood was not affected by energy drink use. Absent energy restriction or other dietary controls, chronic ingestion of a once-daily low-calorie energy drink appears ineffective at improving body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, or strength in sedentary males. However, when combined with exercise, preworkout energy drink consumption may significantly improve some physiological adaptations to combined aerobic and resistance training.

The present study investigates the effect of low-intensity resistance training before and after high-intensity resistance training on arterial stiffness. 30 young healthy subjects were randomly assigned to a group that performed low-intensity resistance training before high-intensity resistance training (BLRT, n = 10), a group that performed low-intensity resistance training after high-intensity resistance training (ALRT, n = 10) and a sedentary control group (n = 10). The BLRT and ALRT groups performed resistance training at 80% and 50% of one repetition maximum twice each week for 10 wk. Arterial stiffness was measured using carotid-femoral and femoral-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV). One-repetition maximum strength in the both ALRT and BLRT significantly increased after the intervention (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). Both carotid-femoral PWV and femoral-ankle PWV after combined training in the ALRT group did not change from before training. In contrast, carotid-femoral PWV after combined training in the BLRT group increased from before training (P < 0.05). Femoral-ankle PWV after combined training in the both BLRT and ALRT groups did not change from before training. These results suggest that although arterial stiffness is increased by low-intensity resistance training before high-intensity resistance training, performing low-intensity resistance training thereafter can prevent the increase of arterial stiffness.

Healthy volunteers (n = 21; mean age, 22 years) were divided into 3 groups: immobilization only (IMM; n = 7), immobilization with training (STR + END; n = 7), and control (no immobilization or training, CNT; n = 7). Endurance training comprised Ex(dyn) at 30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) (duration of each session, ~60 s; twice weekly). Strength training involved intermittent isometric handgrip exercise at 70% MVC (duration of each session, 40 s; twice weekly), repeated 10 times. We used ultrasound methods to measure the brachial artery cross-sectional area and the BF(peak) after Ex(dyn) for 5 min pre- and post-immobilization. We found a significant group by time interaction in BF(peak) (p < 0.05). A significant decrease was found in BF(peak) in the IMM (p < 0.05) between pre- and post-immobilization and a protective effect in the STR + END. The 3-week upper limb immobilization did not influence the baseline artery cross-sectional area. In conclusion, BF(peak) decreased after 3-week upper limb immobilization and a combination of strength training and endurance training preserved the blunted BF(peak).

The aim of the study was to examine whether differences in lung function and respiratory muscle strength exist between trainers predominately engaged in endurance compared to strength-related exercise. A secondary aim was to investigate if lung function and respiratory muscle strength were associated with one-repetition maximum (1RM) in the strength trainers, and with VO2 max and fat-free mass in each respective group. Forty-six males participated in this study, consisting of 24 strength-trained (26.2 ± 6.4 years) and 22 endurance-trained (29.9 ± 7.6 years) participants. Testing involved measures of lung function, respiratory muscle strength, VO2 max, 1RM, and body composition. The endurance-trained compared to strength-trained participants had greater maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) (11.3%, p = 0.02). The strength-trained compared to endurance-trained participants generated greater maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) (14.3%, p = 0.02) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) (12.4%, p = 0.02). Moderate–strong relationships were found between strength-trained respiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP) and squat and deadlift 1RM (r = 0.48–0.55, p ≤ 0.017). For the strength-trained participants, a strong relationship was found between MVV and VO2 max (mL·kg−1·min−1) (r = 0.63, p = 0.003) and a moderate relationship between MIP and fat-free mass (r = 0.42, p = 0.04). It appears that endurance compared to strength trainers have greater muscle endurance, while the latter group exhibits greater respiratory muscle strength. Differences in respiratory muscle strength in resistance trainers may be influenced by lower body strength.

Both groups performed endurance training four times a week during the 6-week maintenance resistance training program. There was a significant increase in strength (multiple-RM test) for three upper and three lower body exercises after the initial 10-week resistance training program. A further significant increase in two exercises (inclined leg press and knee flexion) were observed after 6 weeks of maintenance resistance training and endurance training in both groups. No further significant increases were observed in the four other exercises during maintenance strength training. These latter findings occurred at the same time that VO2max and ventilation threshold increased. These results suggest that strength gains can be maintained with resistance training once or twice a week while focusing on improving aerobic endurance performance without compromising the latter.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH317306&site=ehost-live"

Weightlifters showed 45-55% higher power values than road cyclists and controls, whereas the differences in maximal strength and muscle mass were only 15% and 20%, respectively. These differences were maintained when average power output was expressed relative to body mass or relative to muscle cross-sectional area. Road cyclists recorded 44% higher maximal workloads, whereas submaximal blood lactate concentration was 50-55% lower with increasing workload than in controls and weightlifters. In road cyclists, workloads associated with blood lactate concentrations of 2 and 4 mmol · l -1 were 50-60% higher and occurred at a higher percentage of maximal workload than in weightlifters or controls. Basal serum total testosterone and free testosterone concentrations were lower in elite amateur cyclists than in age-matched weightlifters or untrained individuals. Significant negative correlations were noted between the individual values of maximal workload, workloads at 2 and 4 mmol · l -1 and the individual values of muscle power output ( r = -0.37 to -0.49), as well as the individual basal values of serum total testosterone and free testosterone ( r = -0.39 to -0.41). These results indicate that the specific status of the participants with respect to training, resistance or endurance is important for the magnitude of the neuromuscular, physiological and performance differences observed between weightlifters and road cyclists. The results suggest that, in cycling, long-term endurance training may interfere more with the development of muscle power than with the development of maximal strength, probably mediated by long-term cycling-related impairment in anabolic hormonal status.

However, there is no research examining the effects of improving UB strength has on surfboard paddling ability. This study aimed to determine the influence that improvements in UB closed-kinetic chain maximal strength have on surfboard paddling in both competitive and recreational surfers. Seventeen competitive and recreational male surfers (29.7 ± 7.7 years, 1 77.4 ± 7.4 cm, 76.7 ± 9.9 kg) participated in a repeated- measures, parallel control study design. Anthropometry; 5-, 10, and 15-m sprint; and 400-m endurance surfboard paddling tests along with pull-up and dip 1 repetition maximum strength tests were assessed pre- and postintervention. Subjects in the training group performed 5 weeks of maximal strength training in the pull-up and dip. Differences between the training and control groups were examined postintervention. The training group increased their speed over the 5-, 10-, and 1 5-m sprint, whereas the control group became slower (d= 0.71, 0.51, and 0.4, respectively). The training group also displayed faster endurance paddling performance compared with the control group {d = 0.72). Short-term exposure to maximal strength training elicits improvements in paddling performance measures. However, the magnitude of performance increases seems to be dependent on initial strength levels with differential responses between strong and weaker athletes. Although a longer maximal strength training period may have produced more significant paddling improvements in stronger subjects, practitioners are unlikely to have any more than 5 weeks in an uninterrupted block with competitive surfing athletes. This study reveals that a ""threshold"" level of maximal strength that if possessed, short-term maximal strength training may only provide little improvement in paddling performance.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maximal strength training (MST) on walking economy and walking performance in PAD patients. Ten patients with mild to moderate-severe claudication, classified as Fontaine stage II PAD and with functional limitations from intermittent claudication were recruited and went through an 8-week control period followed by an 8-week, three times a week, MST period. The patients performed four sets of five repetitions dynamic leg press with emphasis on maximal mobilization of force in the concentric action and with a progressive adjusted intensity corresponding to 85–90% of one repetition maximum (1 RM). After the MST period, leg press 1 RM significantly increased by 35.0±10.8 kg (31.3%). Dynamic rate of force development, measured on a force plate installed on the leg press, increased by 1424±1217 N/s (102.7%). The strength improvements led to a significant increase in walking economy of 9.7% when walking horizontally, and to a significant increase in walking performance of 13.6% measured on an incremental treadmill test to exhaustion. No changes were apparent after the control period. No changes in body mass or peak oxygen uptake were observed. MST increases strength in Fontaine stage II PAD patients and leads to improved walking economy. These results suggest that application of MST could accompany aerobic endurance training as a part of the treatment of PAD patients with mild to moderate-severe claudication.

In addition, maximal oxygen consumption ( VOmax) and time to exhaustion (TTE) were measured to determine if sprint interval training (SIT) would augment aerobic performance. Methods: Fourteen recreationally active men completed the study. ST ( n = 7) was performed 2 days/week and CT ( n = 7) was performed 4 days/week for 12 weeks. CT was separated by 24 h to reduce the influence of acute fatigue. Body composition was analyzed pre- and post-intervention. Anaerobic power, one-repetition maximum (1RM) lower- and upper-body strength, VOmax and TTE were analyzed pre-, mid-, and post-training. Training intensity for ST was set at 85 % 1RM and SIT trained using a modified Wingate protocol, adjusted to 20 s. Results: Upper- and lower-body strength improved significantly after training ( p < 0.001) with no difference between the groups ( p > 0.05). VOmax increased 40.9 ± 8.4 to 42.3 ± 7.1 ml/kg/min ( p < 0.05) for CT, whereas ST remained unchanged. A significant difference in VOmax ( p < 0.05) was observed between groups post-intervention (CT: 42.3 ± 7.1 vs. ST: 36.0 ± 3.0 ml/kg/min). A main effect for time and group was observed in TTE ( p < 0.05). A significant main effect for time was observed in average power ( p < 0.05). Conclusion: Preliminary findings suggest that performing concurrent sprint interval and strength training does not attenuate the strength response when compared to ST alone, while also improves aerobic performance measures, such as VOmax at the same time.

Participants (n = 26) were divided into three groups according to their training backgrounds (aerobic, strength or mixed) and submitted to three sessions: (1) determination of the maximum oxygen uptake during the incremental treadmill test to exhaustion and familiarization of the evaluation of maximum strength (1RM) for the half squat; (2) 1RM determination; and (3) strength exercise, four sets at 80% of the 1RM, in which the maximum number of repetitions (MNR), the total weight lifted (TWL), the root mean square (RMS) and median frequency (MF) of the electromyographic (EMG) activity for the second and last repetition were computed. There was an effect of group for MNR, with the aerobic group performing a higher MNR compared to the strength group (P = 0.045), and an effect on MF with a higher value in the second repetition than in the last repetition (P = 0.016). These results demonstrated that individuals with better aerobic fitness were more fatigue resistant than strength trained individuals. The absence of differences in EMG signals indicates that individuals with different training backgrounds have a similar pattern of motor unit recruitment during a resistance exercise performed until failure, and that the greater capacity to perform the MNR probably can be explained by peripheral adaptations.

A secondary purpose was to examine the relationship between strength training volume and strength gain in both groups. Nineteen recreationally active males were divided into CT (n = 11) and ST (n = 8) groups. The CT group performed repeated 1 min efforts at 100% of maximal aerobic speed interspersed by 1 min of passive recovery until accumulating a total running distance of 5km followed by a strength session (consisting of three sets of seven exercises with loads of 8-12 repetition maximum) twice weekly for a period of 12 weeks. The ST group performed only strength training sessions during the same 12-week period. Strength training total volume-load (Σ repetitions x load) for the upperand lower-body was computed, while maximal strength (1RM) was evaluated at baseline, week 8, and week 12. Lower-body volume-load over 12 weeks was not different between groups. Absolute 1RM increased in both groups at week 8 and week 12, while 1RM relative to body mass increased in both groups at week 8, but only ST increased relative maximum strength between week 8 and week 12. There was a statistically significant correlation between strength training lower-body volume-load and maximum strength change between baseline and week 8 for the CT group (r = 0.656), while no significant correlations were found for the ST group. In summary, executing high-intensity intermittent exercise twice a week before strength training did not impair maximal strength after 8 weeks, however, only ST demonstrated an increase in relative strength after 12 weeks.

Given the differences in relative loads and BFR pressures, different mechanisms may be responsible for these increases. PURPOSE: To determine if changes in maximal strength (Δ1RM) and vascular conductance (ΔVC) mediate changes in muscle endurance (ΔEND) following different resistance training modalities. METHODS: This secondary analysis comes from a study where 39 participants trained for 8 weeks with 2 of 4 conditions (randomized, 1 per leg): 70% 1RM without BFR (70/0), 15% 1RM without BFR (15/0), 15% 1RM with BFR at 40% AOP (15/40) and 80% AOP (15/80). Participants performed 4 sets [separated by 90 s (70/0) and 30 s (15/0, 15/40, 15/80)] of knee extension exercise to momentary failure 2x/week. VC (strain gauge plethysmography), 1RM, and END (repetitions to fatigue) were tested pre- and post- training. A two-wave multiple-mediation model (adjusted for baseline values of 1RM, VC, and END), was constructed to compare the direct and indirect effects of Δ1RM and ΔVC on ΔEND. Effects were evaluated relative to other conditions. Data presented as coefficient (95% CI). RESULTS: The model accounted for 35.2% (p<.001) of the variance in ΔEND. Direct effects on ΔEND did not differ between conditions [15/0=13 (9,17); 15/40=15 (11,19); 15/80=15 (11,19); 70/0=13 (9,17) repetitions; all p≥.231]. Only 70/0 increased Δ1RM [3.1 (1.6,4.6) kg]. The effect of Δ1RM on ΔEND was significant [0.5 (0.0,0.9) repetitions]. Additionally, there was evidence that Δ1RM mediated ΔEND, for 70/0 compared to other conditions [vs. 15/0=1.4 (0.1,2.9); 15/40=1.4 (0.1,2.7); 15/80=1.1 (0.1,2.3) repetitions]. While 15/80 [8.30 (2.48,14.13) mL/min] and 70/0 [7.57 (1.74,13.40) mL/min] both increased ΔVC, there was no effect of ΔVC on ΔEND [0.02 (-0.10,0.13) mL/min] nor was there evidence of a mediating effect of ΔVC on ΔEND in any condition. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in Δ1RM led to increased endurance in the 70/0 condition, when compared to other conditions. However, differences in ΔVC did not mediate increased endurance in any condition, suggesting other mechanisms may be responsible for increased endurance following low load training.

Subjects trained the dominant forearm each day for 12 weeks. The nondominant arm was not trained and served as a within-subject control. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P NMRS) was used to identify the power output in watts (W) at the onset, or threshold, of intracellular acidosis (IT) in the exercising muscle during progressive exercise tests to fatigue. After 6 weeks of training, power output at the IT increased by 14 percent (p less than 0.05) in the dominant arm; however, an additional 6 weeks of the same exercise program failed to produce a further increase in IT power. IT power of the nondominant forearm was not changed. In the dominant forearm, endurance time for a submaximal wrist flexion test was increased 34 percent and 58 percent at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Maximal voluntary strength was not affected by training, nor was resting or exercising blood flow. The training program delayed the onset of intracellular acidosis during progressive exercise and increased the capacity for submaximal work. These effects did not appear to depend on an increase in muscle blood flow.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH340135&site=ehost-live"

Twenty untrained healthy participants ( n = 11 heavy metabolic stress interval training, n = 9 moderate metabolic stress interval training) completed 6 weeks of moderate or heavy intensity interval training matched for total work and exercise duration. Carotid artery stiffness, blood pressure contour analysis, and linear and non-linear heart rate variability were assessed before and following training. Overall, carotid arterial stiffness was reduced ( p < 0.01), but metabolic stress-specific alterations were not apparent. There was a trend for increased absolute high-frequency (HF) power ( p = 0.10) whereas both absolute low-frequency (LF) power ( p = 0.05) and overall power ( p = 0.02) were increased to a similar degree following both training programmes. Non-linear heart rate dynamics such as detrended fluctuation analysis $$({| {1 - \alpha_{1} }|})$$ also improved ( p > 0.05). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of interval training at improving arterial stiffness and autonomic function, however, the metabolic stress was not a mediator of this effect. In addition, these changes were also independent of improvements in aerobic capacity, which were only induced by training that involved a high metabolic stress.

Methods: Fifteen normal weighted women involved in recreational resistance training and aerobic training were recruited for the study (age 28.5 ± 6.3 yr, height 167.0 ± 7.0 cm, body mass 66.3 ± 4.2 kg, body mass index 23.8 ± 1.8, mean ± SD). They were randomized into two groups. The 1 KG group (n = 8; energy deficit 1100 kcal/day) was supervised to reduce body weight by 1 kg per week and the 0.5 KG group (n = 7; energy deficit 550 kcal/day) by 0.5 kg per week, respectively. In both groups protein intake was kept at least 1.4 g/kg body weight/day and the weight reduction lasted four weeks. At the beginning of the study the energy need was calculated using food and training diaries. The same measurements were done before and after the 4-week weight reduction period including total body composition (DXA), serum hormone concentrations, jumping ability and strength measurements Results: During the 4-week weight reduction period there were no changes in lean body mass and bone mass, but total body mass, fat mass and fat percentage decreased significantly in both groups. The changes were greater in the 1 KG group than in the 0.5 KG group in total body mass (p < 0.001), fat mass (p < 0.001) and fat percentage (p < 0.01). Serum testosterone concentration decreased significantly from 1.8 ± 1.0 to 1.4 ± 0.9 nmol/l (p < 0.01) in 1 KG and the change was greater in 1 KG (30%, p < 0.001) than in 0.5 KG (3%). On the other hand, SHBG increased significantly in 1 KG from 63.4 ± 17.7 to 82.4 ± 33.0 nmol/l (p < 0.05) during the weight reducing regimen. After the 4-week period there were no changes in strength performance in 0.5 KG group, however in 1 KG maximal strength in bench press decreased (p < 0.05) while endurance strength in squat and counter movement jump improved (p < 0.05) Conclusion: It is concluded that a weight reduction by 0.5 kg per week with ∼1.4 g protein/kg body weight/day can be recommended to normal weighted, physically active women instead of a larger (e.g. 1 kg per week) weight reduction because the latter may lead to a catabolic state. Vertical jumping performance is improved when fat mass and body weight decrease. Thus a moderate weight reduction prior to a major event could be considered beneficial for normal built athletes in jumping events.

Fourteen subjects were randomly divided between two groups. One group performed moderate intensity (55% of maximum oxygen consumption [VO2max], 30 min) cycle training immediately after arm resistance training as concurrent training (CT; n = 7, age: 21.8 ± 0.7 years, height: 1.68 ± 0.06 m, weight: 60.3 ± 7.4 kg); the second group performed the same endurance and arm RT on separate days as control group (SEP; n=7, age: 22.1 ± 0.7 years, height: 1.76 ± 0.05 m, weight: 63.8 ± 3.6 kg). The supervised progressive RT program was designed to induce muscular hypertrophy (3-5 sets of 10 repetitions) with bilateral arm-curl exercise using 75% of the one repetition maximum (1RM) with 2-min rest intervals. The RT program was performed for 8 weeks, twice per week. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), 1RM, and VO2max were measured pre- and post-training. Significant increases in muscle CSA from pre- to post-training were observed in both the SEP (p = 0.001, effect size [ES] = 0.84) and the CT groups (p = 0.004, ES = 0.45). A significant increase in 1RM from pre- to post-training was observed in the SEP (p = 0.025, ES = 0.91) and CT groups (p = 0.001, ES = 2.38). There were no interaction effects (time x group) for CSA, 1RM, or VO2max. A significantly higher percentage change of CSA was observed in the SEP group (12.1 ± 4.9%) compared to the CT group (5.0 ± 2.7%, p = 0.029), but no significant difference was observed in the 1RM (SEP: 19.8 ± 16.8%, CT: 24.3 ± 11.1%). The data suggest that significant improvement of CSA and strength can be expected with progressive resistance training with subsequent endurance exercise performed immediately or on a different day.

Twenty healthy elderly males were divided into two matched groups, in a randomized controlled trial, that trained three sessions per week: concurrent training + dietary walnut consumption (15 g/day for six weeks, CTW: n = 10); concurrent training + control diet (CT: n = 10). Fasting blood samples were taken 48 hours before and after intervention for biochemical assessments. levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased only in CTW compared to baseline (19.8%, p < 0.01). Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) levels significantly decreased only for CTW (i.e., 13%, 18%, and 18.5% at p < 0.01 for all). Testosterone (T) increased after the training compared to pre-training for CTW and CT (10.3%, p < 0.01, 4.27% p < 0.05, respectively), but the increase was significantly higher in CTW (p < 0.05). Serum cortisol (C) was lower for CTW compared to CT (p < 0.01). C-reactive protein (CRP) decreased in CTW in comparison with CT. The present study revealed that 6-week moderate walnut supplementation (15 g/day) improved lipid profile, steroid hormones and systematic inflammation in aged men performing concurrent training. These findings could be attributable to the potential effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contained in walnut (linoleic acid, n-6; linolenic acid, n-3).

Values for filtration capacity, Kf, derived from the slope of calf volume change, Jv, measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, against cuff pressure during a protocol of small cumulative pressure steps, were significantly higher in endurance athletes (5.78 ± 0.88 mL min–1 100 mL–1 mmHg–1 × 10–3, P < 0.05) than controls (3.38 ± 0.32 mL min–1 100 mL–1 mmHg–1 × 10–3) whereas strength-trained athletes had values similar to control (4.08 ± 0.56 mL min–1 100 mL–1 mmHg–1 × 10–3, ns), suggesting that surface area is important. However, when sedentary subjects underwent either a 4-week unilateral dynamic plantarflexion training programme (70% peak power, 20 min day–1, 5 days week–1) or a calf muscle electrical stimulation programme (8 Hz, 3 × 20 min day–1, 5 days week–1), neither of which caused limb blood flow to alter after training nor would be expected to increase capillarity, only the stimulation group showed a significant increase in Kf (6.68 ± 0.62 mL min–1 100 mL–1 mmHg–1 × 10–3 post-training vs. 3.38 ± 0.38 pre-training, P < 0.05). This may be because stimulation enhances perfusion preferentially to glycolytic fibres, or maintains high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or changes lymph clearance.

Twenty-three recreationally active men performed 8 weeks of RT alone (RT group, n = 8) or combined with either high-intensity interval training cycling (HIIT + RT group, n = 8) or moderate-intensity continuous cycling (MICT + RT group, n = 7). Maximal strength and CMJ performance were assessed before (PRE), after 4 weeks of training (MID), and >72 hours (maximal strength) or >5–7 days (CMJ performance) after (POST) the training intervention. Improvements in CMJ relative peak force from both PRE to MID and PRE to POST were attenuated for both HIIT + RT (effect size [ES]: −0.44; ±90% confidence limit, ±0.51 and ES: −0.72; ±0.61, respectively) and MICT + RT (ES: −0.74; ±0.49 and ES: −1.25; ±0.63, respectively). Compared with RT alone, the change in the flight time to contraction time ratio (FT:CT) was attenuated from PRE to MID for MICT + RT (ES: −0.38; ±0.42) and from PRE to POST for both MICT + RT (ES: −0.60; ±0.55) and HIIT + RT (ES: −0.75; ±0.30). PRE to POST changes in both CMJ relative peak force and flight time:contraction time (F:C) ratio were also associated with relative 1 repetition maximum leg press strength gain (r² = 0.26 and 0.19, respectively). These findings highlight the utility of CMJ testing for monitoring interference to improvements in neuromuscular function with concurrent training.

A training program of muscle strength, strength endurance, coordination and improvement of aerobic capacity appears meaningful. Therapy must begin prior to surgery when the diagnosis is first made and should continue longer than 6 months after surgery. Starting with static exercises, there should be a rapid transition to concentric forms. Then strength endurance, which still shows great deficits at the end of the rehabilitation period should be trained and impairments in coordination should be eliminated. The therapeutic strategy for the treatment of the damaged arthritic joint must be shifted toward effective alternatives to the existing forms of therapy. The integration of cost effective sports therapeutic measures, such as in hip sports groups, is indicated because of the constantly aging population with an increasing rate of osteoarthritis and the continuously increasing costs and reductions in budgets.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-795298&site=ehost-live"

Maximum strength (1RM) and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) were evaluated before and after training. Muscle samples were obtained before the training program and 48 h after the last training session. VO 2max improved in 5 ± 0.95 % and 15 ± 1.3 % (pre- to post-test) in groups CT and IT, respectively, when compared to C. Time to exhaustion (TE) improved from pre- to post-test when compared to C (CT = 6.1 ± 0.58 %; IT = 8.3 ± 0.88 %; ST = 3.2 ± 0.66 %). 1RM increased from pre-to post-test only in ST and CT groups (ST = 18.5 ± 3.16 %; CT = 17.6 ± 3.01 %). Similarly, ST and CT groups increased quadriceps CSA from pre-to post-test (6.2 ± 1.4 %; 7.8 ± 1.66 %). The p70S6K1 total protein content increased after CT. The ST group showed increased Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 (45.0 ± 3.3 %) whereas AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172 increased only in IT group, (100 ± 17.6 %). In summary, our data suggest that despite the differences in molecular adaptations between training regimens, CT did not blunt muscle strength and hypertrophy increments when compared with ST.

This has been variously described as the concurrent training effect or the interference effect. It now appears that the genetic and molecular mechanisms of adaptation induced by resistance- and endurance-based training are distinct, with each mode of exercise activating and (or) repressing specific subsets of genes and cellular signalling pathways. This brief review will summarize our current understanding of the molecular responses to strength and endurance training, and will examine the molecular evidence for an interference effect when concurrent training is undertaken. A better understanding of the activation and interaction of the molecular pathways in response to these different modes of exercise will permit sport scientists to develop improved training programs capable of maximizing both strength and endurance.

Endurance training leads to massive increases of mitochondria and improves capillarization. Strength training increases muscle cross-sectional area mainly by increasing myofibrillar proteins. Over the last 15 years many molecular techniques have become available which have allowed for understanding of the basic adaptive mechanism behind muscle plasticity. Multiple parallel pathways increasing mainly transcriptional activities for selected muscle proteins are responsible for endurance training related muscle changes. Muscle changes associated with strength training are dominantly achieved by modifying translational mechanisms. This review intends to delineate the relevant molecular mechanism in a functional context which is responsible for the phenotypic plasticity of adult skeletal muscle tissue.

Monitoring training progress during exercise training in cancer survivors: a submaximal exercise test as an alternative for a maximal exercise test? Objective: To examine the use of a submaximal exercise test in detecting change in fitness level after a physical training program, and to investigate the correlation of outcomes as measured submaximally or maximally. Design: A prospective study in which exercise testing was performed before and after training intervention. Setting: Academic and general hospital and rehabilitation center. Participants: Cancer survivors (N=147) (all cancer types, medical treatment completed ≥3mo ago) attended a 12-week supervised exercise program. Interventions: A 12-week training program including aerobic training, strength training, and group sport. Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures were changes in peak oxygen uptake (Vo 2peak) and peak power output (both determined during exhaustive exercise testing) and submaximal heart rate (determined during submaximal testing at a fixed workload). Results: The Vo 2peak and peak power output increased and the submaximal heart rate decreased significantly from baseline to postintervention (P<.001). Changes in submaximal heart rate were only weakly correlated with changes in Vo 2peak and peak power output. Comparing the participants performing submaximal testing with a heart rate less than 140 beats per minute (bpm) versus the participants achieving a heart rate of 140bpm or higher showed that changes in submaximal heart rate in the group cycling with moderate to high intensity (ie, heart rate ≥140bpm) were clearly related to changes in VO2peak and peak power output. Conclusions: For the monitoring of training progress in daily clinical practice, changes in heart rate at a fixed submaximal workload that requires a heart rate greater than 140bpm may serve as an alternative to an exhaustive exercise test.

The main purpose of the investigation was to study growth trends of these parameters of female field hockey players and to analyze the character and feature of their development. Standard anthropometric measurements were used for evaluation of morphological characteristics. Matiegka's equations were used for computation of body composition's parameters. Modification of the Harvard step test was used for estimation of physical capacity. Respiratory performance was evaluated using vitalograph. Static strength of the hands was obtained using a handgrip. Characteristics of health- and skill-related fitness were evaluated using the following test battery: standing broad jump, 30 m dash run, flying 30 m test, 210 yards shuttle run, 2000 m run, push-ups and 20 m zig-zag run. Results of the study were as follows: the functional characteristics have the greatest total increase (about 108-144 %) during the age span considered (from 10 to 18 years). Stature and other length parameters increased about 18-20 %. The periods of the acceleration of increases in morphological parameters precede the periods of the sizable increases in functional parameters. Based upon the analysis of aspects of health- and skill-related fitness of players training and practicing in hockey has a beneficial effect on this group of characteristics.

The signaling pathways responsible for regulating cell size in adult skeletal muscle under growth and atrophy conditions are poorly understood. However, recent evidence suggests a role for the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Protein translation is regulated through the phosphorylation of initiation factors that are controlled by signaling pathways downstream of PI3K/Akt. Recent work in mammals has suggested that activation of Akt/PKB, a Ser-Thr phosphatidylinositol-regulated kinase, and its downstream targets, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), may be critical regulators of postnatal cell size in multiple organ systems, including skeletal muscle. This paper will review some of the recent data that demonstrate the critical role of Akt/mTOR signaling in the regulation of postnatal muscle size, especially under conditions of increased external loading.

However, the feasibility of this approach is problematic. This study aims to compare two multidisciplinary programs used to improve weight loss. Methods: Fifty-two obese individuals were subjected to an Enhanced Lifestyle Counselling associated with, according to their own choice, dieting (N = 11), or dieting þ aerobic training (n = 18), or dieting + resistance training program (n = 23). The study experiment spanned 16 weeks divided into two phases. The first phase lasted 04 weeks and was oriented to enhance motivation and establishing changes in behaviours related to dietary and sedentary lifestyle. The second phase lasted 12 weeks and was oriented to add aerobic or resistance training. Body compositions, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and cardio-respiratory fitness were assessed. Results: Data demonstrated that all obesity treatment programs were able to improve all studied variables. Weight loss levels were -6.03 ± 2.08, -10.5 ± 2.33, and -9.37 ± 1.99 kg in Dieting, DAT and DRT groups, respectively. Our results noted also that exercise training could play an important role in reducing obesity and its consequences. Nevertheless, modifications were more important in DRT at the explosivity and muscle strength and in DAT at fat percentage, aerobic capacity, SA, and CVR factors. Conclusion: The current evidence noted that both multidisciplinary weight loss programs were efficient in the treatment of obesity and its comorbidity. Moreover, the use of aerobic exercises was more effective in reducing body fat and improving cardiorespiratory fitness. However, using resistance exercises appeared to be more appropriate to enhance the muscle potential.

The majority of the studies suggests that regular physical activity can improve fatigue, depression and quality of life in people with MS, however most of the researchers worked without any guidelines for physical activity adapted to the MS, which are still under review by the scientific community.

Twenty seven healthy males volunteered to participate in this study and assigned into three groups; according to; condensed multiple-set group (COM; n=9), circuit multiple-set group (CIM; n=8) and control group (CON; n=10). Subjects in the COM performed resistance training exercises for 3 sets continuously; whereas subjects in the CIM performed resistance training program for 1 set of each exercise and come back to the first exercise and this approach was performed 3 times each training session. Pre and post 8 weeks of training, one repetition maximum (1RM) and muscle endurance (60% of 1RM) for leg press and bench press, body weight, arm and thigh circumference and body composition were measured. No significant differences in body mass, arm and thigh circumference and muscular strength for the bench press exercise were observed for any group during the 8 weeks of training period (p > 0.05). A significant increase in muscular strength for the leg press exercise was observed for COM after 8 weeks of training (p < 0.05). Both the COM and CIM groups showed significant improvement compared with pre training and CON in muscular endurance for the bench press and leg press exercises (p < 0.05). In conclusion, it can be recommended that, COM is better for improving muscle strength and both training programs are proper for increasing muscular endurance.

The TMG-derived velocity of contraction (Vc), which can be calculated from the ratio between maximal radial displacement and the sum of contraction time and delay time, has been proposed for evaluating athletes. However, its sensitivity to training effects and possible relation with changes in soccer players' neuromuscular performance have not yet been addressed. To test this possibility, twenty-two male Brazilian elite soccer players were assessed using TMG-derived Vc, unloaded squat jump, countermovement jump and drop jump at 45 cm, loaded jump squat and linear (20 m) and change of direction (COD) sprint tests, prior to and after an 8-week period, between two consecutive official tournaments, during which the concurrency between endurance and strength-power training commonly impairs neuromuscular capacities. Magnitude-based inference was used to detect meaningful training effects. From pre- to post-tests, it was observed likely to almost certainly improvements in all modes of jumping tests. In addition, we could verify decrements in the 20-m and COD sprint performances, which were rated as very likely and almost certainly, respectively. Finally, both rectus femoris and biceps femoris muscles presented a likely reduction in Vc. Therefore, chronic decreases in sprinting speed are possibly accompanied by a reduced TMG-derived Vc. From a practical standpoint, the TMG-derived Vc can be used to monitor negative specific-soccer training effects related to potential impairments in maximum speed.

The SA group demonstrated slightly greater CSA and maximal absolute strength than the SPA group, while the EA group demonstrated the smallest values both in CSA and especially in maximal strength. When the maximal forces were related to CSA of the muscles, the mean value for the SA group of 60.8 plus/minus 10.0 N.cm-2 remained slightly greater than that recorded in the SPA group 55.0 plus/minus 3.1 N.cm-2 and significantly greater than that recorded in the EA group 49.3 plus/minus 4.0 N.cm-2. The mean value in the SPA was also significantly greater than that of the EA group. The isometric force-time curves differed between the groups so that the times taken to produce the same absolute force were the shortest in the SPA group and the longest in the EA group. With force expressed as a percentage of the maximum, the force-time curves showed that the SPA group demonstrated still shorter times to a given value, especially at the lower force levels, than the other two groups. With regard to the differences in force production per CSA and in the shape of the force-time curves, the present findings may be explained by possible differences both in the rate and the amount of neural activation of the muscles and/or in the qualitative characteristics of the muscle tissue itself. The present findings characterize the very specific nature of high resistance strength-, sprint- and endurance-training stimuli over a very prolonged period of time.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH249646&site=ehost-live"

Introduction: The myonuclear domain theory postulates that myonuclei are added to muscle fibers when increases in fiber cross-sectional area (i.e., hypertrophy) are ≥26%. However, recent studies have reported increased myonuclear content with lower levels (e.g., 12%) of muscle fiber hypertrophy. Purpose: This study aimed to determine whether a muscle fiber hypertrophy “threshold” is required to drive the addition of new myonuclei to existing muscle fibers. Methods: Studies of resistance training endurance training with or without nutrient (i.e., protein) supplementation and steroid administration with measures of muscle fiber hypertrophy and myonuclei number as primary or secondary outcomes were considered. Twenty-seven studies incorporating 62 treatment groups and 903 subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analyses. Results: Muscle fiber hypertrophy of ≤10% induces increases in myonuclear content, although a significantly higher number of myonuclei are observed when muscle hypertrophy is ~22%. Additional analyses showed that age, sex, and muscle fiber type do not influence muscle fiber hypertrophy or myonuclei addition. Conclusions: Although a more consistent myonuclei addition occurs when muscle fiber hypertrophy is >22%, our results challenge the concept of a muscle hypertrophy threshold as significant myonuclei addition occurs with lower muscle hypertrophy (i.e., <10%).

Low-load resistance training can induce a comparable hypertrophy to that from high load resistance training when each set is performed until lifting failure. This is attributable to the greater exercise volume and metabolic stress achieved with low-load exercise at lifting failure, which however results in a prolonged exercise set. Importantly, these studies were conducted on untrained or recreationally active adults, with the training period being less than 3 months. Endurance exercises (walking and cycling) at moderate intensity are also capable of eliciting muscle hypertrophy but at much slower rates (required over months rather than weeks) in limited muscle or age groups. Blood flow restriction (BFR) in working muscles, however, accelerates the development of metabolic fatigue, alleviating the time consuming issue associated with low-load or endurance training. These alternative training methods, however, cannot completely replace the conventional high-load resistance training, which provides a superior strength gain as well as performance improvement even for trained individuals. The alternative approaches, therefore, may be considered for those who are less enthusiastic or under certain medical conditions, or who have no or limited access to proper equipment. However, people should be aware that low-load resistance training or endurance training incurs a substantial effort or discomfort at lifting failure or with BFR. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each method will help to assign the most suitable training programs for the clients' goals and needs.

Method: Twenty-two male handball players, between the ages of 17 and 24, and in good health, were randomly divided into three groups. Two were trained groups, weight training (WTG) and jump training combined with weight training (CTG), and one was a control group (CG). Maximal isometric force and maximal concentric power were assessed by a supine leg press, squat jump (SJ), counter movement jump (CMJ), and surface EMG was used to determine changes in muscle adaptation before and after the training period. Results: After 6-wk training programs, the two training groups increased maximal isometric force, maximal concentric power, and squat jump performance. However, only combined training presented a significant increase in height jump performance during the countermovement jump (P &lt; 0.05). EMG analysis (as interpreted through the root mean square values) showed that the SJ was performed similarly before and after the training period for the two training groups. However, during the CMJ, only the CTG group adopted a new technique manifested by a short transition phase together with an increase in knee joint stiffness and knee extensor muscle activation and rectus femoris ratio. Conclusion: It was suggested that the central activities in knee joint during the transition phase, in conjunction with intrinsic muscle contractile properties, play a major role in the regulation of performance during a CMJ. Furthermore, our study suggests that a change in maximal strength and/or explosive strength does not necessarily cause changes in combined movement such as the stretch shortening cycle.

During MVC, evoked contractions of the knee extensors muscles were performed to assess neuromuscular properties. Metabolism was assessed using oxygen uptake kinetics model. Before the RST session master athletes showed lower knee extensors MVC values than young subjects (257 vs. 354 N p<0.05) without any difference in oxygen kinetics (respectively for elederly and young: oxygen slow component (VO2sc): 231 vs. 214ml∙min1 and time constant (Ii): 27.8 vs. 25.ls, p>0.05).

This cross-sectional study investigates deficits and associations in muscle strength, 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), aerobic capacity (VO(2peak)), and physical activity (PA) in independent ambulatory children with lumbosacral spina bifida. Method. Twenty-tree children participated (13 boys, 10 girls). Mean age (SD): 10.4 (+/-3.1) years. Muscle strength (manual muscle testing and hand-held dynamometry), 6MWD, VO(2peak) (maximal exercise test on a treadmill), and PA (quantity and energy expenditure [EE]), were measured and compared with aged-matched reference values. Results. Strength of upper and lower extremity muscles, and VO(2peak) were significantly lower compared to reference values. Mean Z-scores ranged from -1.2 to -2.9 for muscle strength, and from -1.7 to -4.1 for VO2peak. EE ranged from 73 - 84% of predicted EE. 6MWD was significantly associated with muscle strength of hip abductors and foot dorsal flexors. VO(2peak) was significantly associated with strength of hip flexors, hip abductors, knee extensors, foot dorsal flexors, and calf muscles. Conclusions. These children have significantly reduced muscle strength, 6MWD, VO(2peak) and lower levels of PA, compared to reference values. VO(2peak) and 6MWD were significantly associated with muscle strength, especially with hip abductor and ankle muscles. Therefore, even in independent ambulating children training on endurance and muscle strength seems indicated.

Regenerating skeletal muscle to counteract this process can be achieved by resistance training (RT); however, the skeletal muscle hypertrophic response is highly variable across individuals. The molecular underpinnings of this heterogeneity are unclear but likely to include differential muscle gene expression. METHODS: This study explored transcriptional networks linked to RT-induced muscle hypertrophy classified as (1) predictive of hypertrophy, (2) responsive to RT independent of hypertrophy, or (3) plastic (or changes) with hypertrophy. Older adults (n=31, 18F/13M, 70±4y) performed 14-wk RT 3d/wk and muscle hypertrophy was assessed by change in: mid- thigh muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) [computed tomography (CT)], thigh lean mass [dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)], and vastus lateralis myofiber CSA [histomorphometry]. Transcriptome-wide poly-A RNA-seq was performed on vastus lateralis tissue collected pre (n=31) and post-RT (n=22). Prediction networks (baseline only) were identified by Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA). To identify Plasticity networks, WGCNA change indices for paired samples were calculated and correlated to changes in muscle size outcomes. Pathway-Level Information ExtractoR (PLIER) was applied to identify response networks and link genes to biological annotation. RESULTS: Prediction networks (n=8) confirmed transcripts previously connected to resistance/aerobic training adaptations in the MetaMEx database while revealing novel genes that should fuel future research to understand the influence of baseline muscle gene expression on hypertrophy. Response networks (n=6) indicated RT-induced increase in aerobic metabolism and reduced expression of genes associated with spliceosome biology and type-I myofibers. Fewer Plasticity networks were identified (n=2). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest inter-individual differences in baseline gene expression may contribute more to muscle hypertrophic response heterogeneity than RT-induced changes. Investigation of factors (e.g., epigenomic) modulating baseline gene expression profiles are of great interest for future studies.

As a consequence, premature fatigue and a cycle of further inactivity and disability ensue. Thus, different fitness components, such as muscular strength and endurance may need to be targeted to counteract functional decline. Although, resistance training periodization has been shown to result in superior muscle strength adaptations in younger populations, the effects are less clear in older adults. We recruited previously trained, older male and female subjects (n = 15, > 60 years of age) for a ten-week pre- post-test design, two days/week periodized resistance training program. The program consisted of one day high-intensity/low volume [∼85% of the estimated 1 repetition maximum (RM) with 6 repetitions] and one day low-moderate intensity/high volume (∼67% of the estimated 1RM with 12 repetitions) training. 1RM increased significantly (P = 0.000) for both the leg press and chest press exercises after resistance training by 17.9 and 17.3%, respectively. Moreover, the subjects completed more repetitions with the higher load (60% of post-training 1RM) after training, thus volume load (VL) (number of repetitions × 60% of 1RM load) increased significantly (P = 0.000) in both the leg press (43.3%) and the chest press (21.6%) exercises. Chest press strength and endurance improvements showed a significant (P = 0.017) moderate correlation (r = 0.59). On the other hand, no changes were detected in body composition and lean mass as a result of the program. Resistance training periodization is a feasible strategy in older populations to improve muscular strength and muscular endurance simultaneously. The results indicate that exercise professionals can utilize even low frequency periodization training to improve muscle strength and endurance in active older adults in a time-efficient manner.

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1019 (571 men) Flemish adults, aged 18-75. Muscular strength was evaluated by measuring isometric knee extension and flexion peak torque, using a Biodex System Pro 3 dynamometer. Aerobic fitness was quantified as VO2peak and was determined during a maximal cycle ergometer exercise test. Both strength and aerobic fitness were scaled for differences in FFM, using allometric analyses. A validated metabolic syndrome risk score that was based on waist circumference, triglycerides, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and HDL cholesterol was used. Metabolic syndrome risk score, strength, and aerobic fitness were analyzed as continuous variables using multiple linear regression. Results: Metabolic syndrome risk was inversely associated with strength, independently of aerobic fitness, and after adjustment for age, height, education level, smoking status, and dietary intake in women (beta = -0.172, P &lt; 0.001). In men, however, adjustment for aerobic fitness attenuated the inverse association between strength and metabolic syndrome risk (beta = -0.044, P &gt; 0.05). Independently of strength, aerobic fitness was inversely associated with metabolic syndrome risk (men: beta = -0.309, P &lt; 0.001; women: 13 = -0.208, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, independent associations were found for strength and aerobic fitness with several individual metabolic syndrome risk factors in women, and most of these associations were only partially mediated by central and general adiposity indicators. Conclusion: Although cross-sectional, the present results support inclusion of strength training in addition to aerobic exercise in physical activity recommendations for women, because both types of activity might show additional effects in reducing the risk of the metabolic syndrome.

Although no significant group × time interactions were found, there was a significant main effect of time for push-ups and squats (both p < 0.001). Participants enjoyed the classes and most planned to continue. Both classes improved muscular endurance although no significant differences were found between them. Activity classes provide college students with an option for increasing their weekly PA and help maintain body composition.

Methods: Training was 6 d·wk−1 on a small-footprint gravity-independent flywheel resistance and aerobic device; 3 d of maximal flywheel supine quadriceps and calf exercises with continuous rowing separated by 4 to 6 h, and 3 d of interval rowing. Vastus lateralis (VL) and soleus (SOL) muscle biopsies were obtained from eight healthy males (age, 28 ± 4 yr; BMI, 25 ± 3 kg·m−2; V˙O2max, 42 ± 6 mL·kg−1·min−1) before and after 6° head-down tilt bed rest. Vastus lateralis and SOL myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIa single muscle fiber size and functional characteristics, as well as overall fiber type distribution, capillarization, and metabolic enzyme activities were evaluated. Results: In the VL, MHC I size and power (absolute and normalized) were preserved. The MHC IIa fibers hypertrophied (+6%, P < 0.05) without a change in absolute power, so normalized power declined (−7%, P < 0.05). In the SOL, MHC I fibers atrophied (−9%) and absolute power declined (−17%) (P < 0.05), whereas normalized power was maintained. Size, absolute power, and normalized power were protected in the less-abundant MHC IIa fibers. Reduced MHC coexpressing hybrid fibers, generally indicative of an exercise training effect, was apparent in the VL, whereas fiber type was maintained in the SOL. Capillarization and metabolic enzymes were generally preserved or increased in VL and SOL. Conclusions: The integrated resistance and aerobic training protocol on a device maintains several key myocellular characteristics during prolonged unloading, but further refinement of the exercise approach to fully protect the SOL is warranted.

Furthermore, no data exist on whether knee sleeves of varying compressive tightness impact muscular performance similar to commonly used knee wraps, which are both generally effective and more so when increasingly constrictive. Fifteen resistance trained, knee sleeve naive, recreational weight liftingmen (22.1 6 4.1 years; 177.5 6 5.9 cm; 87.8 6 7.8 kg) visited the laboratory on 3 separate occasions one week apart, assigned in a randomized, crossover, and counterbalanced fashion to either a minimally supportive control sleeve (CS) condition, a manufacturer-recommended sizing neoprene knee sleeve (“normal” sleeve; NS), or a one size smaller (than NS) neoprene knee sleeve (tighter sleeve [TS]). On each visit, subjects sequentially completed vertical jump (countermovement and squat jumps for both peak and mean power), one repetition maximum (1RM) barbell squat, and GymAware assessments (peak power, peak velocity, and dip) at 90% (reported) and 100% (tested) 1RM as well as one-leg extension (1RM, repetitions to failure, and total volume load at 75% 1RM) tests. All data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance at p, 0.05. Analysis revealed a significant condition effect on barbell squat 1RM (p 5 0.003; η² 0.339), whereby both NS (p 5 0.044; 166 6 24 kg) and TS (p 5 0.019; 166 6 21 kg) outperformed CS (161 6 22 kg), with no difference between neoprene sleeves. Conversely, no other tested parameters differed between knee sleeve conditions (p ≥ 0.05). The present results demonstrate that neoprene knee sleeves may function independent of tightness, relative to recommended sizing and ultimately unlike knee wraps. Furthermore, the singular benefits observed on barbell squat maximal strength potentially suggests an exercise-specific benefit yet to be fully elucidated.

Thirty sedentary healthy male subjects were randomly assigned to one of three training groups that performed 10 wk of 3-dDTwk-1 high-intensity strength training (S), cycle endurance training (E), or concurrent strength and endurance training (CC). Strength, quadriceps-muscle biopsies, computed tomography scans at mid-thigh, and surface electromyogram (EMG) assessments were made before and after training. S and CC groups demonstrated similar increases (P &lt; 0.0001) in both thigh extensor (12 and 14 %) and flexor/adductor (7 and 6 %) muscle areas. Type II myofiber areas similarly increased (P &lt; 0.002) in both S (24 %) and CC (28 %) groups, whereas the increase (P &lt; 0.004) in Type I area with S training (19 %) was also similar to the nonsignificant (P = 0.041) increase with CC training (13 %). Significant increases (P &lt; 0.005) in maximal isometric knee-extension torque were accompanied by nonsignificant (P less than or equal to 0.07) increases in root mean squared EMG amplitude of the quadriceps musculature for both S and C groups. No changes (P &gt; 0.38) in the EMG/torque relation across 20 to 100 % maximal voluntary contractions occurred in any group. A small 3 % increase (P &lt; 0.01) in thigh extensor area was the only change in any of the above variables with E training. Findings indicate 3-dDTwk-1 concurrent performance of both strength and endurance training does not impair adaptations in strength, muscle hypertrophy, and neural activation induced by strength training alone. Results provide a physiological basis to support several performance studies that consistently indicate 3-dDTwk-1 concurrent training does not impair strength development over the short term.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-817761&site=ehost-live"

Dynamic and isometric strength, EMG, voluntary activation, muscle cross-sectional area and endurance performance were measured. All groups increased dynamic one-repetition maximum (p<0.001; DD 13±7%, E+S 12±9% and S+E 17±12%) and isometric force (p<0.05–0.01), muscle cross-sectional area (p<0.001) and maximal power output during cycling (p<0.001). DD and S+E increased voluntary activation during training (p<0.05–0.01). In E+S no increase in voluntary activation was detected after 12 or 24 weeks. E+S also showed unchanged and S+E increased maximum EMG after 24 weeks during maximal isometric muscle actions. A high correlation (p<0.001, r=0.83) between the individual changes in voluntary activation and maximal knee extension force was found for E+S during weeks 13–24. Neural adaptations showed indications of being compromised and highly individual relating to changes in isometric strength when E+S-training was performed, while gains in one-repetition maximum, endurance performance and hypertrophy did not differ between the training modes.

Previously untrained men were divided into strength (S: n = 16), endurance (E: n = 11) or concurrent strength and endurance (SE: n = 11) training groups. S and E trained 2 times and SE 2 + 2 times a week for strength and endurance during the 21-week period. Maximal unilateral isometric and bilateral concentric forces of leg muscles increased similarly in S and SE by 20-28 % (p < 0.01) and improvements in isometric forces were accompanied by increases (p < 0.05) of maximal muscle activation. Rate of force development of isometric action (p < 0.05) improved only in S. The increase in muscle cross-sectional area of the quadriceps femoris in SE (11 %, p < 0.001) were greater than in S (6 %, p < 0.001) or in E (2 %, p < 0.05). SE and E increased maximal cycling power (SE: 17 % and E: 11 %, p < 0.001) and VO2MAX (SE: 17 %, p < 0.001 and E: 5 %, ns.). These results suggest that the present moderate volume 21-week concurrent SE training in previously untrained men optimizes the magnitude of muscle hypertrophy, maximal strength and endurance development, but interferes explosive strength development, compared with strength or endurance training alone.

Purpose This study aimed to determine if peritraining whey protein supplementation combined with MMIT can improve glycemic control. Methods In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 24 men (55.7 ± 5.6 yr) with T2D performed MMIT with whey (20 g) or placebo control for 10 wk. Glycemic control was assessed via glucose disposal rate during a euglycemic insulin clamp, fasting blood glucose concentration, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. Changes in peak oxygen consumption, 1-repetition maximum strength, vastus lateralis muscle, and subcutaneous adipose thicknesses, and waist circumference were also assessed. Results Ten weeks of MMIT substantially improved glucose disposal rate by 27.5% (90% confidence interval, 1.2%-60.7%) and 24.8% (-5.4% to 64.8%) in the whey and control groups, respectively. There were likely and possible reductions in fasting blood glucose by -17.4% (-30.6% to -1.6%) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance by -14.1% (-25.3% to 1.08%) in the whey group; however, whey effects were not clearly beneficial to glycemic outcomes relative to the control. MMIT also clearly substantially improved 1-repetition maximum by 20.6% (16.3%-24.9%) and 22.7% (18.4%-27.2%), peak oxygen consumption by 22.6% (12.0%-26.2%) and 18.5% (10.5%-27.4%), and vastus lateralis muscle thickness by 18.9% (12.0%-26.2%) and 18.6% (10.5%-27.4%) and possibly reduced waist circumference by -2.1% (-3.1% to -1.0%) and -1.9% (-3.7% to -0.1%) in the control and whey groups, respectively, but the whey-control outcome was trivial or unclear. Conclusions A clinically meaningful enhancement in glycemic control after 10 wk of MMIT was not clearly advanced with peritraining whey protein supplementation in middle-age men with T2D.

Experimental study carried out with individuals of both sexes, with cardiometabolic risk factors, members of a Cardiorespiratory Rehabilitation Program (PROCOR) of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). A combined physical training program (aerobic and strength) with load training progression was used, performed at a frequency of three weekly sessions, on alternate days, for nine weeks and using shin guards, elastic bands or just body weight. Functional capacity, anthropometric profile and body composition of individuals were evaluated before and after the intervention. The comparison of data before and after the intervention period was performed using the Student's t -test for paired samples and the Wilcoxon test. Improvements statistically significant were observed in the tests related to functional capacity, ""Sit and Stand"", ""8-foot-up-and-go"" at usual and maximum speeds and ""March"", along with a decrease in anthropometric measurements of hip circumference, body fat percentage, waist-to-hip ratio, and fat mass in the android region. In addition, the program was well-tolerated with a low rate of sample losses. The results of this study suggest that only 9 weeks of combined training at low cost and easy applicability is able to promote improvement in parameters related to functional capacity, anthropometric profile, and body composition of trained older people with cardiovascular risk factors. • Nine weeks of combined training are already able to reduce fat mass, visceral fat and increase the functional capacity of older adults with cardiometabolic risk factors. • A combined training of low cost and easy applicability is a great tool for morphological and functional outcomes, even when applied for a short period of time to individuals already trained, with cardiometabolic risk factors, and without nutritional guidance.

In an effort to further research examining these principles, an investigation was designed and completed to evaluate the compatibility of cardiovascular endurance and neuromuscular power training. Sixteen Division-I collegiate baseball players were divided into two training groups with lower body power measured before and after their college playing season. The two groups differed in training in that one group performed moderate- to high-intense cardiovascular endurance training 3-4 days per week throughout the season, while the other group participated in speed/speed endurance training. A significant difference between groups (P < .05) was identified in the change in lower body power during the baseball season. During the season, the endurance training group decreased an average of 39.50 ± 128.03 watts while the speed group improved an average of 210.63 ± 168.96 watts. These data demonstrate that moderate- to high-intense cardiovascular endurance and neuromuscular power training do not appear to be compatible when performed simultaneously, For baseball players, athletes who rely heavily on power and speed, conventional baseball conditioning involving significant amounts of cardiovascular endurance training should be altered to include more speed/power interval training.

"Normalized Muscle Strength, Aerobic Capacity, and Walking Performance in Chronic Stroke: A Population-Based Study on the Potential for Endurance and Resistance Training","Severinsen, Kaare; Jakobsen, Johannes K.; Overgaard, Kristian; Andersen, Henning","Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation",="00039993",,="20111001","92","10","1663","6","66856713",,,"Article",,,"Abstract: Severinsen K, Jakobsen JK, Overgaard K, Andersen H. Normalized muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and walking performance in chronic stroke: a population-based study on the potential for endurance and resistance training. Objectives: To assess muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and walking performance compared with normative values in chronic hemiparetic stroke patients and, thereby, to investigate the potential for endurance and resistance training. Second, to study the relations between muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and walking performance using normalized test values. Design: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Setting: University hospital, outpatient clinic. Participants: Patients (N=48) aged 50 to 80 years with reduced muscle strength and walking capacity due to an ischemic stroke 6 to 36 months prior to recruitment. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Peak oxygen consumption (Vo 2peak) and isometric knee extensor muscle strength at the paretic knee were expressed as absolute and normalized values using normative data. The six-minute walk test (6MWT) and the habitual ten-meter walk test (10MWT) were secondary parameters. Results: Peak Vo 2 was 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71–84) of the expected value, and the strength of the paretic knee was 71% (95% CI, 64–78), whereas walking speed (10MWT) was 59% (95% CI, 52–66) and walking distance (6MWT) was 59% (95% CI, 52–67). The normalized Vo 2peak correlated to the normalized 6MWT (r=.58; P<.001) and normalized 10MWT (r=.53; P<.001). Normalized strength of the paretic knee correlated to normalized 6MWT (r=.40; P<.01) and normalized 10MWT (r=.31; P<.05). Conclusions: Lower extremity muscle strength and aerobic capacity are related to walking performance, which suggests a potential for endurance and resistance training in rehabilitation of walking performance in chronic hemiparesis after stroke. Correction for the influence of age, weight, and height providing normalized values improves the interpretation of severity of impairments and enables comparisons between patients.

Over 20 years ago, it was first observed that performing endurance exercise after resistance exercise could have detrimental effects on strength gains. At the cellular level, specific protein candidates have been suggested to mediate this training interference; however, at present, the physiological reason(s) behind the concurrent training effect remain largely unknown. Even less is known regarding the optimal nutritional strategies to support concurrent training and whether unique nutritional approaches are needed to support endurance and resistance exercise during concurrent training approaches. In this review, we will discuss the importance of protein supplementation for both endurance and resistance training adaptation and highlight additional nutritional strategies that may support concurrent training. Finally, we will attempt to synergise current understanding of the interaction between physiological responses and nutritional approaches into practical recommendations for concurrent training.

We studied 14 patients, mean age 57 yr, mean NYHA class 2.7, mean LVEF 29 %, and mean VO2max 17.2 mL.kg-1.min-1. They underwent a 6 months' outpatient ""in-hospital"" training program (80 sessions). After an introduction period the program was subdivided into four cycles in which endurance and strength were revalued and progressively increased. Endurance was measured by spiro-ergometric exercise testing with concomitant lactate determination, while strength was measured on an isokinetic dynamometer. The compliance ratio was 89 % and there were no major problems during training. NYHA class improved from a mean of 2.7 to 1.5 (P = 0.0001), working capacity from 83 to 100 W (P = 0.001), VO2 from 16.7 to 18.4 mL.kg-1.min-1 (P = 0.02), and maximal exercise lactate from 4.1 to 5.2 mmol.L-1 (P = 0.01). At isokinetic testing we found a significant 18 % increase in muscular endurance of knee flexors (P = 0.008) and 25 % increase of knee extensors (P = 0.007). The increase of peak torque, total work, and average power reached statistical significance only for the knee extensors. This pilot study showed that progressively adapted global strength training in association with traditional endurance training is feasible for selected patients with CHF. Additional larger studies should be done to test the effects, the safety, and the composition of such supervised ""in-hospital"" training programs.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-75732&site=ehost-live"

Individuals trained in aerobic resistance seem to show more VO2 platô. Kettlebell (KTB) training is a physical/sports training method used as an alternative to improve anaerobic power, but it is also possible that KTB training generates enough stimuli to enhance aerobic fitness. Objective: To analyze the occurrence of VO2 plato in women submitted to KTB training. Materials and methods: 16 healthy adult women practiced KTB training for 12 weeks and were evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to assess the adaptations to training and the occurrence of VO2 platô. The plateau was identified by the differences between two consecutive stages (Taylor's criterion, 1955) and by statistical analysis (""t"" student test or Mann-Witney). The volunteers were submitted to strength evaluation, by a maximal repetition test (1RM), and anthropometric measurements. All tests were applied before and after training. The normality was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The value of p <0.05 was considered. Results: There was an increase of 8.5% (p <0.001) in VO2 max and 10.5% (p <0.001) in the time of CPET; the 1RM increased 25.3% (p <0.001), due to the training. The occurrence of VO2platô reduced after the 12-week training by both the Taylor criterion (25% to 18.7%) and the statistical analysis (12.5% to 6.25%). Conclusion: The strength training with KTB provoked cardiovascular and neuromuscular adaptations. However, these adaptations did not result in increased occurrence of VO2 platô.

The pedagogical experiment of 8 month's duration was conducted with 16 collegiate middle-distance runners of medium preparation level. The subject's mean age was 20.8 plus/minus 1.5 years, body height 180.6 plus/minus 5.2 cm, body weight 69.5 plus/minus 5.8 kg. In laboratory conditions were recorded the runners' muscle contractile properties, maximal O2 uptake and respiratory system capacity. In field conditions were determined the aerobic and anaerobic threshold velocities that reflect muscles oxidative properties and HR characteristics corresponding to these velocities. It appeared that the experimental group applying stagewise endurance and strength properties development showed during the experiment statistically significant increase in aerobic and anaerobic threshold speed and in muscles contractile properties-voluntary maximal strength and strength gradient of quadriceps, results of maximal speed and jumping tests. Statistically significant improvement of these characteristics led to considerable increase in anaerobic local muscle endurance (p is less than 0.01) and race result improvement. The yielded shifts were accompanied by efficient adaptation of central O2 transportation system. Simultaneously was confirmed the advantage of harmonious stagewise developing of muscles oxidative and contractile properties in the experimental group as compared to the simultaneous developing of the same properties in the control group.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-20732&site=ehost-live"

Methods: Thirty-one healthy men (65-74 yr) were divided into three treatment groups to train 2 X wk-1 for 16 wk: S (N = 10), E (N = 11), or SE (N = 10; 1 X wk-1 S + I X wk-1 E). The subjects were tested at 8-wk intervals (i.e., weeks 8 and 16). Results: There were no significant differences between S- and SE-induced muscle hypertrophy (11% and 11 %) and maximal strength (41 % and 38 %) gains of the legs as well as between E- and SE-induced Wmax (28 % and 23 %) gains. The increase in arm strength in S (36 %) was greater than that recorded in SE (22 %) and greater than that recorded in E (0 %). Conclusions: Prolonged combined resistance and endurance training in older men seemed to lead to similar gains in muscle mass, maximal strength, and power of the legs as resistance training alone and to similar gains in maximal peak power output measured in an incremental cycling test as endurance training alone. These findings may have an effect on how resistance exercise is prescribed to older adults.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-953704&site=ehost-live"

However, this has not been studied during work with a small muscle mass, which does not challenge convective oxygen supply. We therefore randomized 23 adult females with no arm-training history to either one-arm maximal strength training or a control group. The training group performed five sets of five repetitions of dynamic arm curls against a near-maximal load, 3 days a week for 8 weeks. This training increased maximal strength by 75% and improved rate of force development during both strength and endurance exercise, suggesting that each arm curl became more efficient. This coincided with a 17-18% reduction in oxygen cost at standardized submaximal workloads (work economy), and a 21% higher peak oxygen uptake and 30% higher peak load during maximal arm endurance exercise. Blood flow assessed by Doppler ultrasound in the axillary artery supplying the working biceps brachii and brachialis muscles could not explain the training-induced adaptations. These data suggest that maximal strength training improved work economy and endurance performance in the skeletal muscle, and that these effects are independent of convective oxygen supply.

Running economy is improved by performing combined endurance training with either heavy or explosive strength training. However, heavy strength training is recommended for improving cycling economy. Equivocal findings exist regarding the effects on power output or velocity at the lactate threshold. Concurrent endurance and heavy strength training can increase running speed and power output at VO2max ( Vmax and Wmax, respectively) or time to exhaustion at Vmax and Wmax. Combining endurance training with either explosive or heavy strength training can improve running performance, while there is most compelling evidence of an additive effect on cycling performance when heavy strength training is used. It is suggested that the improved endurance performance may relate to delayed activation of less efficient type II fibers, improved neuromuscular efficiency, conversion of fast-twitch type IIX fibers into more fatigue-resistant type IIA fibers, or improved musculo-tendinous stiffness.

Because time may be a barrier to physical exercise practice, the aim of this study was to verify whether the order of execution of endurance and resistance exercises, in concurrent training, has different effects on the metabolic responses during recovery. Thirteen healthy women [24.40 (1.67) years, Mean (SD)] were investigated for energy expenditure (EE), oxygen consumption (VO2), ventilation (Ve), respiratory frequency (RF), proportion of oxygen in expired air (FeO2) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) both before and after three concurrent endurance and resistance trainings, carried out in different orders: endurance-resistance training (ERT), resistance-endurance training (RET) and alternating endurance-resistance training (AERT). AERT elicited a significantly greater increase of EE, VO2, and Ve and a greater decrease of FeO2. ERT elicited a lower increase of RPE. Acute post-exercise physiological responses to concurrent endurance and resistance physical exercise seem to depend on the order of execution of the two parts: among the selected protocols, AERT seems to elicit the best responses.

Only few studies have been published in the scientific literature to date. Aim: The intention of this examination was to describe the performance capability of female rink hockey players in order to enhance the understanding of the sport's peculiarities and to improve training scheduling. Investigations of the endurance, strength, functional movements as well as sprint and jump abilities were conducted in 12 female rink hockey players of a national league team. Results: Endurance values of 2.86±0.51 W/kg and an estimated maximum oxygen uptake of 38.6±6.1 ml*kg-1*min-1 were obtained in the investigation. Isokinetic testing revealed a balanced leg strength (extensors right 2.0, left 1.9 Nm/kg, flexors 1.0 Nm/ kg both legs). The average sprint times were slower for those trials with skates than in trials with shoes 5 m, 5-20 m and 20 m (1.40 vs. 1.39 / 2.52 vs. 2.47 / 3.92 vs. 3.86 s). Similar average jump heights were measured for different tasks (counter movement jump 28.3 vs. drop jump 28.0 cm). The average score of the FMSTM amounted to 16.2. Discussion: The results of the present study reveal improvable endurance, deficiencies in some functional movements and reduced sprint ability in female rink hockey players. The hamstrings to quadriceps torque ratio and the relative torque appear to be similar to other athletes. The mean jump ability of female rink hockey players is similar to adult female college students.

Eleven young women volunteered to participate in this study and underwent tests of their dynamic strength and a maximal incremental test on both the treadmill and cycle ergometer. Four concurrent training sessions were performed: resistance-running (RRu), resistance-cycling (RC), running-resistance (RuR) and cycling-resistance (CR). The aerobic exercise lasted 30 minutes and was performed at a heart rate equivalent to 95% of the second ventilatory threshold. The resistance exercise lasted approximately 21 minutes and consisted of 4 sets of 10 RM in each exercise. The VO2 was continuously evaluated through the portable gas analyser. No differences were found in the VO2 between the intra-session exercise sequence independently of aerobic modality (i.e., RRu vs. RuR, and RC vs. CR), and the sessions with the running aerobic exercise showed greater VO2 than sessions using cycling aerobic exercise in both exercise sequences (VO2aerobic (ml ⋅ kg-1 ⋅ min-1) - RRu: 27.5; RuR: 27.1; RC: 20.2; CR: 20.8). The present study showed that the intra-session exercise sequence during concurrent training does not influence VO2. However, the optimal combination of resistance and aerobic exercise should include running in order to increase VO2 and optimize EE.

Design: Two-group randomized trial. Subjects: Ambulatory and sedentary. Interventions: MSTEP©, a personally adapted exercise regimen done on most days including two days of high intensity exercise; guidelines recommending 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic and strength training two times per week. Main measures: Primary outcome was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) at 12 months; secondary outcomes were composite measures of physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. Results: In total, 137 people were randomized, 66 were lost over 12 months leaving 71 with outcome data, 34 in MSTEP© group, and 37 in the Guideline group. Exercise enjoyment and confidence and exercise-induced fatigue predicted retention. There were no differences between groups on the proportion making a 10% increase in VO2peak (27.1% MSTEP© vs 29.6% Guidelines; OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.23–3.08) by the 12 month assessment. The effect on fatigue was larger in the MSTEP© group than the Guideline groups (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 0.93–2.74), the effect on physical function was more modest (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.80–2.25), and null for health-related quality of life outcomes. Conclusions: The disappointing exercise retention suggests that people with multiple sclerosis may not consider exercise important to their brain health. Either type of exercise resulted in stable exercise capacity over 1 year in those sticking with the programme.

In the present article, the physical aspect will be evaluated with a focus on what limits performance, and how training can be conducted to improve performance. Specifically how intensified training, i.e., increasing the amount of aerobic high-intensity and speed endurance training, affects physiological adaptations and performance of trained subjects. Periods of speed endurance training do improve performance in events lasting 30 s-4 min, and when combined with aerobic high-intensity sessions, also performance during longer events. Athletes in team sports involving intense exercise actions and endurance aspects, such as soccer and basketball, can also benefit from intensified training. Speed endurance training does reduce energy expenditure and increase expression of muscle Na+, K+ pump α subunits, which may preserve muscle cell excitability and delay fatigue development during intense exercise. When various types of training are conducted in the same period (concurrent training), as done in a number of sports, one type of training may blunt the effect of other types of training. It is not, however, clear how various training modalities are affecting each other, and this issue should be addressed in future studies.

A single training session can induce residual fatigue, which can consequently impair performance during the training if an improper recovery is performed. To minimize the effects of negative interference, training periodization should consider the concurrent training characteristics that are presented in extreme conditioning programs. Conclusions: Although the literature presents a gap in periodization models for extreme conditioning programs, an individual analysis of the traditional and block periodization lets to observe that the block periodization presents a greater applicability for this type of programs.

Until now walking or bicycle endurance training was recommended to patients as an adjunctive measure. Whether peripheral muscle strength training may also improve exercise tolerance in this population is under discussion. Therefore an alternate peripheral training program using weight collars was developed. The program was tested in 27 candidates for heart transplantation under stable medical therapy (intervention n = 14, controls n = 13) in a prospective 12-week randomised study (medical therapy plus training twice a week vs. medical therapy only). Peak VO2 increased from 12.4 +/- 3.3 ml.min-1.kg-1 to 14.2 +/- 3.4 ml.min-1.kg-1 (p &lt; 0.01) in the training group and remained unchanged in the controls (12,9 +/- 3.9 ml.min-1.kg-1 and 12.8 +/- 4,3 ml.min-1.kg-1). Correspondingly NYHA-classification was improved in the training group but remained the same in therapy only patients. Trained patients were also able to significantly increase their training weights. These results show beneficial effects of a peripheral muscular strength-training program in patients with severe heart failure and should be tested in further studies in comparison with bicycle endurance training.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-671244&site=ehost-live"

Strategies to maintain functional mitochondria during aging include training; cardiovascular exercise has been suggested as the best method, but strength training has also been identified as essential to health and healthy aging. We therefore investigated the effects of concurrent exercise training and dietary habits on epigenetic mechanisms involved in mitochondrial (mt) functions and biogenesis. We analyzed epigenetic biomarkers that directly target the key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, PGC-1α, and mtDNA content. Thirty-six healthy, sedentary participants completed a 12-week concurrent training program. Before and after the intervention, dried blood spot samples and data on eating habits, lifestyle, and body composition were collected. MiR-23a, miR-30e expression, and mtDNA content were analyzed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. PGC-1α methylation was analyzed using bisulfite pyrosequencing. MiR-23a, miR-30e expression, and PGC-1α methylation decreased after the intervention (p < 0.05). PGC-1α methylation increased with the consumption of red and processed meat, and mtDNA content increased with the ingestion of cruciferous vegetables (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that concurrent training could improve mitochondrial biogenesis and functions by altering the epigenetic regulation. These alterations can also be detected outside of the skeletal muscle and could potentially affect athletic performance.

However, the effects of PBM in healthy individuals who underwent a neuromuscular adaptation training remain unclear. To investigate the effects of PBM during a training program combining sprints and explosive squats exercises on clinical, functional, and systemic outcomes in trained healthy individuals compared to a placebo intervention and a control. We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Healthy males were randomly assigned to three groups: active PBM (30 J per site), placebo, or control (passive recovery). The participants performed a six-week (12 sessions) of a training program consisting of a combination of sprints and squats with recovery applied between sprints and squats. To prevent the influence of the primary neuromuscular adaptation to exercise on the results, all participants had to participate in a period of six weeks of exercise training program. Functional, clinical, and psychological outcomes and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were assessed at baseline and after six weeks. Results are expressed as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Thirty-nine healthy male volunteers (aged 18–30 years; body mass index 23.9 ± 3 kg/m²) were recruited. There was no significant time by group interaction, and no significant effect of group, but there was a significant effect of time for maximal voluntary isometric contraction (primary outcome) (MD=22 Nm/kg; 95%CI: 3.9, 40) and for squat jump (MD=1.6 cm; 95CI%: 0.7, 2.5). There was no significant interaction (time*group), time, or group effect for the other outcomes. The addition of PBM to a combined training performed for six weeks in previously trained individuals did not result in additional benefits compared to placebo or no additional intervention. • No evidence was found that photobiomodulation applied during combined training promote any additional effects. • Participants already adapted to a specific stimulus or previously trained do not benefit from the use of photobiomodulation for recovery. • Photobiomodulation was not superior to placebo and control on functional, clinical, and systemic outcomes.

These changes have considerable impact on the ability to perform daily activities, especially when associated with chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardio-vascular disease and dyslipidemia, as well as geriatric syndromes, like mobility impairment, falls and frailty. Scientific research has shown that physical activity and exercise can slow the physiological aging clock. Particularly, active elderly people seem to age ""successfully"" compared to sedentary ones. The aim of our work is to review evidence-based recommendations for physical activity, exercise and diet that would help to preserve muscle mass and strength, and to reduce the gain of fat mass in older adults. Increasing levels of physical activity, in particular resistance training mixed with aerobic exercise, and adequate protein nutrition intake should be an integral component in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity and metabolic syndrome in elderly subjects.

Epidemiological studies suggest that regular physical activity prevents type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality in large part through these risk factors. Although randomized controlled trials with the prevention or treatment of the MetS as the main outcome have not been published, several large randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence that favourable lifestyle changes, including regular physical activity, are effective in the prevention of type 2 diabetes in individuals who are overweight and have impaired glucose tolerance. Compliance with the current recommendations to increase the total volume of moderate-intensity physical activity and to maintain good cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness appears to markedly decrease the likelihood of developing the MetS, especially in high-risk groups. Walking is the most common form of physical activity— it improves health in many ways and is generally safe. Therefore, brisk walking for at least 30 min daily can be recommended as the principal form of physical activity at the population level. If there are no contraindications, more vigorous physical exercise or resistance training should also be considered to obtain additional health benefits. Unstructured and low-intensity physical activity may also decrease the likelihood of developing the MetS, especially when substituted for sedentary behaviours such as watching television. The measurement of maximal oxygen consumption may provide an efficient means to target even individuals with relatively few metabolic risk factors who may benefit from more intensive intervention.

However, there is evidence of an accelerated aging process among PLWH, which includes physical impairments. Relative to the other consequences of aging among PLWH, physical impairments have not received much attention in the literature. There is an emerging need to study physical deficits in this population. Objectives: The main purposes of this review are to explore factors contributing to physical dysfunction in this population, describe common physical impairments, discuss physical performance measures, and make recommendations for rehabilitation professionals regarding exercise prescription for PLWH. Major Findings: Factors contributing to physical impairments include HIV severity, comorbidities, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Problems with muscle strength and mass, gait, static and dynamic balance, aerobic capacity, and frailty are common among PLWH and can have a negative impact on fall risk and functional performance. Several physical performance measures can be used for screening and assessment purposes, including the Short Physical Performance Battery, Six-Minute Walk Test, 5-times sit-to-stand, Community Mobility and Balance Scale, and gait speed tests. Conclusions: Physical impairments are prevalent among PLWH. Rehabilitation providers should identify PLWH who are at risk of developing physical impairments. Exercise interventions including aerobic, resistance, and balance training appear to benefit PLWH. More research is warranted to investigate outcome measures that should be routinely used in clinical practice and the efficacy of exercise in this population.

However, the addition of aerobic and resistance exercise may preserve lean mass and lead to enhanced physical function. PURPOSE: To evaluate physical function after a nutrition and exercise intervention at a community aging center in older adults with obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg·m²). METHODS: Twenty-five older adults (7 males and 18 females, 72.6+6.4 yr, 164.4+9.2 cm, 97.4+14.2 kg) participated in a 3-month intervention consisting of weekly dietitian sessions, twice weekly physical therapist-led strength training classes and individualized at-home aerobic training programs. Physical function was assessed before, monthly, and after the intervention using the 6-minute walk test, 5-chairstands test, gait speed and grip strength. Appendicular Skeletal Mass Index (ASMI) in a subsample (n=14) was measured using bioelectrical impedance and normalized to height. Variables were evaluated using ANOVA with repeated measures and correlations between percent weight loss and percent changes in physical function were conducted. RESULTS: Participants lost an average of 6.0+4.9 kg over the 3-months and experienced consistent losses of 2 kg per month (P<0.01). ASMI remained constant throughout the intervention (4.91+0.87 vs 4.85+0.88 kg·m², P=0.31). BMI decreased from 36.1+4.8 to 34.0+5.0 (P<0.001). All measures of physical function improved throughout the intervention. Gait speed rose from 1.23+0.17 to 1.36+0.20 m·s-1 (P<0.001) and 6-min walk distance increased from 423+77 to 465+99 m (P<0.001). Time to complete 5-chairstands decreased by 1.67+2.15 s (P<0.01) and grip strength of the left and right hands increased by 8 and 9%, respectively (P<0.01). Percent change in body weight did not correlate to changes in physical function (P>0.05) but improvements in 6-min walk distance was correlated to faster completion of 5-chairstands (r=-0.44, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: A diet and exercise intervention can decrease body weight while preserving muscle mass and enhancing physical function. Changes in body weight do not appear to be related to physical function suggesting other factors, like enhanced strength and aerobic capacity may play a role.

The degree of difficulty in accurately defining the physical requirements and characteristics has created opportunity for anecdotal evidence to emerge alongside evidence-based results in preparing combat soldiers for occupational tasks. A search was conducted of several databases to find relevant research identifying the predominant issues in preparing soldiers for combat tasks and information that would help guide intervention strategies. Current issues include high musculoskeletal injury rates in soldiers, and that current physical training protocols have been shown to contribute to increased risk of injury. External load carriage has a negative effect on physical performance and task specific skills. Program design demonstrates that periodised programs have a greater increase in occupational related tasks and fitness tests than non-periodised programs. Training interventions best suited to achieve improved levels of performance consist of periodised concurrent training programs, aimed at improving maximal strength and aerobic capacity concurrently. Increases in overall fitness levels can lower injury potential and improve performance on occupational tasks. These programs should allow adequate rest to maintain high levels of preparedness and can be integrated into the daily occupational training cycle.

This narrative review characterizes the main physical attributes related to performance of these occupational tasks and reviews physical training intervention studies in military settings to improve performance in these military tasks. Load carriage performance requires both aerobic and neuromuscular fitness with greater emphasis on maximal strength and absolute maximal oxygen uptake, especially when carrying heavier loads. In manual material handling, maximal strength and power are strongly associated with discrete lifting, while muscular strength, muscular endurance and aerobic fitness are also associated with repetitive lifting performance. Maximal strength including grip strength, muscular endurance, absolute maximal oxygen uptake and anaerobic capacity are associated with casualty evacuation performance. The results of the present review particularly emphasize the role of muscular fitness in successful performance of the reviewed military occupational tasks. Training intervention studies indicate that load carriage performance can be effectively improved by combining strength, aerobic and specific load carriage training. Improvement in maximal lifting capacity can be achieved by strength training or combined strength and aerobic training, while strength and aerobic training alone, or their combination are effective in improving repetitive lifting, and carry tasks. Only a few studies are available for casualty evacuation and the results are inconclusive but may indicate benefits of strength or combined training. Moreover, emphasis on lower volume but higher intensity in combined training may be a feasible and effective mode to improve military occupational performance in recruits and active-duty soldiers.

Eighteen women (36-61 yr), randomized to a RT or CT group, trained 3 times per wk. Both groups participated in resistance workouts that included 30 min of upper and lower body exercises where fatigue occurred between 8-12 repetitions. The CT group then participated in 30 min of moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise during each training session. Pretesting and post-testing included: height; weight; resting blood pressure; body composition from skinfolds; arm, thigh, and waist circumference measurements; 3-repetition maximum (3RM) strength in bench press and leg press; and cardiovascular itness using a Rockport walk test. Also measured were fasting serum glucose, total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. FFM was calculated. MANOV A was used to evaluate group differences and time-related changes in all other variables. Several (2 x 2) repeated measures ANOV As were used to compare dependent variable scores across time and between treatment groups. No significant differences between treatments or time by treatment interactions were found. Improvements in upper body strength, body composition, FFM, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and cardiovascular itness were observed; however, only increases in HDL cholesterol, FFM and bench press strength were significant (p = 0.03, p = 0.045, and p < 0.001, respectively). Results indicated that upper body strength and HDL cholesterol significantly increased after 12 wks in a RT or CT exercise program. While neither training modality (RT or CT) proved superior, it is possible that a longer training program and more participants would yield significant differences.

Six young women were assigned to group lift-row (LR), in which weight training was followed immediately by endurance training, while another group, row-lift (RL, n = 7) performed endurance training before strength training. A third group, lift only (LO, n = 6), participated in only strength training. Endurance training (rowing) was performed 3 times per week for 45 minutes at 70 % VO2max. Strength training consisted of 45 minutes of 5-6 lower-body exercises designed to increase strength. Results indicated that 1 repetition maximum leg press increased rho 26.6, 27.4, and 25.9 % (p &lt; 0.05) for the LR, RL, and LO groups, respectively. Only the LR group experienced increases in peak anaerobic power, anaerobic capacity (ANC), and relative ANC. However, no differences in power measures were detectable among groups at the conclusion of training. Maximum heart rate (MHR) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) increased for all groups from pre- to post-training but reached significance for the LR and LO groups only with no between-group differences. Percentage of body fat and time to exhaustion during the VO2max test manifested no pre- to posttraining or intergroup differences. The present results do not demonstrate any negative effects on strength development for women concurrently training for strength and endurance. Furthermore, the sequence or order of training did not influence strength training adaptations but may have limited aerobic adaptations.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-164965&site=ehost-live"

Thirty-seven volunteers (13 female, 24 male), recruited from The Steadward Center, University of Alberta, participated in a 12-week training program. Participants, aged 18.0 to 51.5 years, with either spinal cord lesion (SCL), cerebral palsy/head injury (CP/HI) or multiple sclerosis (MS) were recruited. Participants were stratified by disability and gender and then randomly assigned to one of the four groups: 1) strength (S)--10 participants; 2) endurance (E)--10 participants; 3) strength and endurance (S&E)--8 participants; and 4) control--9 participants. The S and E groups trained 3 times per week with a moderately intense, individually prescribed progressive training program. The S&E group trained 5 days per week, alternating daily strength and endurance sessions, except on Fridays when they performed both modes of training. Participants were tested prior to training, at the mid-point, and after completing 12 weeks of training. Significant strength increases were found for the S&E group with no evidence (p&lt;.05) of a diminished response compared to the S group. No significant changes were demonstrated in the participants' peak oxygen consumption or oxygen consumption at ventilatory threshold. Significant gains in the power outputs achieved at ventilatory threshold and peak aerobic efforts were observed in the E and S&E groups. Strength training performed by the S&E group facilitated a significantly greater gain in power output at ventilatory threshold when compared to the E group. No significant changes were demonstrated in muscle hypertrophy measured by diagnostic ultrasound.

It can no longer be perceived as before, as a compilation of other martial arts. MMA shows originality in training methods, health aspects, performance requirements or even moral-volitional qualities. The aim of the paper is to analyse the physiological aspects of MMA in both training and combat loads, to discuss the issue of injuries in MMA and to provide a comparison with other martial arts. Studies focusing directly on MMA wrestlers have been selected. These have included both amateur and professional athletes. The databases Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Scholar were used as sources. MMA ranks among sports with high-intensity workload, wrestlers achieve high levels of lactate and other metabolic markers. They need above-average aerobic capacity and perform well in upper body strength tests. Injury rates in MMA do not differ significantly from those in professional-level martial arts. Most injuries are associated with lacerations on the head. The requirements of extensive workload during performance must be reflected in training. Encouragement of aerobic and anaerobic endurance abilities in conjunction with optimum strength training seems crucial. It is essential to include prophylaxis as regards head concussions and strive for maximum safety of the sportsman during combat. Further research is required to confirm some of the conclusions, the limitations of which are due to the number and quality of the selected studies.

Whether (a) sport training can accelerate and ultimately enhance this biological development and (b) the existence of certain ages when training might prove to be more effective in improving performance, particularly early in childhood, remains uncertain. Physiological adaptations to endurance training in prepubertal children (improvements in maximal oxygen uptake) are dampened compared with adults, but enhancements of strength following resistance training are equally effective at all ages. The extent that intensive training regimens characteristic of early sport specialization in children can trigger physiological and performance adaptations may therefore depend on the form of exercise involved. Clearly, additional research is needed to enhance the understanding of the physiological responses to intensive sport training in prepubertal individuals.

The athletes were tested on a standardized battery of tests, which included: height, weight, sum of five skinfolds, percent body fat, aerobic power, anaerobic power, 10 flexibility tests, and 6 strength tests. The mean scores for each of the groups were compared using a factorial ANOVA for groups of unequal size, and the significance of the differences between means were calculated. The results indicated that the mean height (164 cm), weight (48 kg), sum of five skinfolds (25 mm), and percent body fat (12 percent) all remained relatively constant over the three years of the test. Aerobic and anaerobic power scores also remained at relatively constant levels, with a mean time on the anaerobic treadmill test of 40 sec, and a mean VO2max of 50 ml.kg-1min-1. The actual time on the aerobic treadmill decreased significantly, but with the increases in weight and oxygen consumption experienced by several of the athletes, the VO2max values remained constant. There were significant decreases in flexibility test scores over the three years of the testing, including trunk flexion-extension, right and left shoulder flexion-extension, and right hip flexion. The one significant increase in flexibility occurred in hip abduction, or the ability to assume a front splits position. There were also significant decreases in shoulder extension strength, including both left and right shoulder strength values. The majority of the peak torque scores decreased over the three years of the testing sessions, but the mean values were not statistically significant.

Endurance (n = 87; distance runners, road cyclists, paddlers, skiers), power (n = 77; sprinters, throwers, combat sport athletes, body builders), team (n = 64; basketball, soccer, volleyball) and non-athletes (n = 223) performed a countermovement jump and an incremental running test to estimate their maximal anaerobic and aerobic power (VO2max), respectively. Dynamometry and M-mode echocardiography were used to measure muscle strength and stroke volume. The VO2max (L min-1) was larger in endurance and team athletes than in power athletes and non-athletes (p < 0.05). Athletes had a larger stroke volume, left ventricular mass and left ventricular wall thickness than non-athletes (p < 0.02), but there were no significant differences between athlete groups. The higher anaerobic power in power and team athletes than in endurance athletes and non-athletes (p < 0.001) was associated with a larger force (p < 0.001), but not faster contractile properties. Endurance athletes (20.6%) had a higher (p < 0.05) aerobic:anaerobic power ratio than controls and power and team athletes (14.0-15.3%). The larger oxygen pulse, without significant differences in stroke volume, in endurance than power athletes indicates a larger oxygen extraction during exercise. Power athletes had stronger, but not faster, muscles than endurance athletes. The similar VO2max in endurance and team athletes and similar jump power in team and power athletes suggest that concurrent training does not necessarily impair power or endurance performance.

At birth, the distribution of muscle fibres and the activity of enzymes in muscle are different from in adults, but these differences disappear at about age 6. On the other hand, muscle fibre thickness increases from birth to about 18 years of age and this is concurrent with increases in muscular strength. The increase in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) that accompanies growth and maturation in the human has been attributed in the main to appreciating muscle mass. During exercise, heart rate and cardiac output increase in the child as in the adult, but the heart rate in the child is greater and the stroke volume smaller. Children also evidence a diminished blood pressure response to exercise. The young are less capable of regulating core temperature at exercise than adults and are more readily dehydrated. Very limited data suggest that muscle energy substrate storage and utilisation in children are such that they are less capable of anaerobic metabolism than adults. Generally, children respond to aerobic training as do adults, but such training in the first decade of life has been reported to have negligible effects. Limited data indicate that the nature of training may alter muscle fibre distribution in youthful athletes, and that muscle fibre hypertrophy can be induced in the young by means of strength and power training. That training alters muscle enzyme activity in young athletes remains debatable. There is little doubt that training stimulates bone growth in young humans. This stimulatory effect seems to be related to gains in muscular strength. The concern has been advanced that very intense physical training may retard skeletal growth. Superior muscular strength bears upon youthful athletic success. Although strength training is more effective in postpubertal males, resistance training of young children can be both safe and useful.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH271898&site=ehost-live"

Total weight lifted per circuit increased 57%. Lean body mass increased 2.2%, skinfold thicknesses decreased, and other measures of body composition remained unchanged.

Male Wistar strain rats were used in this study. One-dimensional electrophoresis was used for separation of MyHC and MyLC isoforms and two-dimensional electrophoresis was used for identification of MyLC different isoforms. A difference in the relative content of MyLC isoforms between FT muscles exists only in the case of MyLC 1slow and 2slow isoforms. Differences in the relative content of MyHC between FT muscles are considerably larger than differences in the MyLC isoforms. MyHC and MyLC isoforms both participate in the remodelling of contractile proteins during exercise training. In conclusion: The present study shows some discrepancy between the modulation of MyHC and MyLC isoforms in muscles with different oxidative potential during adaptation to endurance and resistance training. In ST muscles, there is full agreement between the increase in the relative content of MyHC IIa isoform and MyLC 2fast and 3fast isoforms during resistance training without significant changes during endurance training. The ratio of MyLC 3 and MyLC 2 isoforms increases during both types of exercise training, but it is two times higher during resistance training.

The research sample consisted of the 20 best Czechs (average height, age, and bodyweight of 180cm, 28.5 years and 90.7 kg respectively) according to the CrossFit Open ranking. The questionnaire was used to collect information regarding the training regime and their current performance parameters. Descriptive statistics include the correlation between individual performances and overall ranking. Crossfitters had very good strength parameters in exercises with external load and also with their bodyweight (average values: clean and jerk 141.5 kg, snatch 113.9 kg, back squat 184.1 kg, strict press 87.2 kg, deadlift 217.9 kg, strict handstand push-ups 21.5 reps., pull-ups 20.6 reps.). The Olympic weightlifting performance (snatch and clean and jerk) was the strongest predictor for placing (-.606 resp. -.625, α = .01). The weekly training time was 800-900 minutes and contained mostly combined training units with a total of 9.2.

Fourteen references obtained from the PubMed, SciELO and Schoolar Google databases following the keywords ""concurrent training, concurrent exercise, muscular plasticity, physical exercise"" were used. Muscle plasticity can reduce the adaptations induced by the modalities that make up concurrent training. Therefore, when planning the training program, it is necessary to observe strategies that seek to minimize this effect.

"Poliomyelitis and the post-polio syndrome: exercise capacities and adaptation - current research, future directions, and widespread applicability.","Birk, T.J.","Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise",="01959131",,="19930401","25","4","466","7","SPH342385",,,"Article","EXERCISE; POLIOMYELITIS; DIAGNOSIS; RESEARCH",,"Poliomyelitis is an acute viral disease that attacks the brain and the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Damage to the lower motor neurons usually results in atrophy and weakness of muscle groups, perhaps paralysis and possibly deformity. A second type, bulbar poliomyelitis, infects the medulla oblongata and may result in dysfunction of the swallowing mechanism along with respiratory and circulatory distress. Minor forms of poliomyelitis result in fever, sore throat, headache, and upper body stiffness, but leave no significant atrophy or paralysis. The purpose of this paper is to review post-polio syndrome (PPS) as well as the effect of exercise on the symptoms and morphologic adaptations to PPS and where future research efforts should be directed. The most common features of PPS for over 350,000 afflicted survivors include general fatigue, weakness, and joint/muscle pain. The primary reasons for these symptoms include 1) destruction of the anterior horn cells by the polio virus, leaving fewer motor neurons to induce muscle contraction; 2) unaffected motor unit enlargement by reinnervation through terminal sprouting; and 3) defective transmission at the neuromuscular junction secondary to failure of terminal axonal sprout. Acute responses to resistive exercise suggest significant muscle strength decrements in the knee extensors compared with similar aged people without polio. However, limited training investigation indicates significant strength increases for the knee extensors following at least 6 wk of training. Acute aerobic responses also differ significantly from those observed in aged-matched control subjects. Chronic aerobic responses to limited training studies suggest significant elevations in maximal oxygen uptake. Although fatigue during physical activity may be a combination of central and peripheral factors, it is speculated that for the person with PPS the cause is more peripheral. Current and future research directed at determining the site of fatigue will result in treatment programs optimizing various exercise modalities and conservation of energy.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH342385&site=ehost-live"

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials found in PubMed and Physiotherapy Evidence (PEDro) databases. Results: We found 7 randomized controlled trials (463 participants) with physical exercise programs comprising aerobic training, inspiratory muscle training, strength training and combined training. The programs surveyed consisted of: aerobic training (duration of protocols between 4 weeks and 6 months; duration of session, 20-80 min; frequency, 3-5 times a week; intensity, 60-90% of heart rate reserve), combined training and combined training + inspiratory muscle training (12-week duration in 60 min twice weekly sessions; aerobic intensity of 55-65% of the heart rate reserve) and resistance training (duration of 8 weeks, in 20-45 min sessions distributed 2-3 times a week, using 3 sets of 10-40 repetitions, with an intensity of 20-30% of peak torque). Conclusion: The practice of physical exercises (with duration, frequency and intensity established) in cardiac rehabilitation programs proposed were beneficial for patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Researchers who have examined the mechanism behind PAP following complex strength training, have established a relationship between post-activation potentiation and improvements in speed and explosive strength of athletes. Most of the presented papers in this review have confirmed the effectiveness of PAP in eliciting performance in tasks requiring speed, jumping ability and agility in soccer players. These studies were discussed in detail in terms of research groups, methods, training means and study results. Many of these publications have also considered the aspect of rest intervals between the conditioning exercise and the subsequent explosive activity. Most authors indicate the necessity to individualize the time of the rest interval, depending on the athletes training status, strength level and most of all on the intensity and volume of the conditioning exercise. Some scientists have also attempted to incorporate PAP into warm-up protocols, especially prior to speed and power training sessions. A two-way analysis of the impact of PAP, separately on sprint speed and power of the players. The focus was on demonstrating the positive or negative impact of activating exercises on the two variables discussed. The last part of the paper presents the conclusions drawn based on the results of the studies and suggests the objectives of future research. Most publications have documented the results for male participants, whereas little data is available regarding the use of PAP in female soccer players.

Post-exercise hypotension (PEH) has been used as a non-pharmacological means to control and reduce BP. Few have evaluated PEH response following a bout of exercise combining CV and RT, whether or not there is an order effect, or if PEH continues when activities of daily living (ADLs) are resumed. Participants (N = 10) completed a non-exercise control, a graded exercise test (GXT), and two concurrent sessions (CVRT and RTCV). Each session was followed by a 60-minute laboratory and 3-hour ADLs PEH assessment, respectively. Two-way and Welch-one-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to determine differences between among conditions in PEH. There was a significant interaction between BP and condition following the 60-minute laboratory measure (p = .030, ηp² = .166) and the ADLs BP assessments (p = .008, ηp2 = .993), respectively. PEH occurred following concurrent exercise conditions at minute 45 for RTCV (118 + 8, p = .041; 95% CI [0.223, 17.443]) and minutes 50 (117 + 9; p = .036 95% CI [0.441, 21.097]) and 55 (118 + 8; p < .001; 95% CI [5.884, 14.731]) following CVRT. BP was elevated during ADLs following the control session compared to the GXT, RTCV, and CVRT. Regardless of the order, concurrent exercise is effective in potentiating PEH. Elevation in BP associated with ADLs can be mitigated if exercise is performed previously.

This study analyzed hemodynamics and autonomic modulation after a single session of aerobic (A), resistance (R), and concurrent (A + R) exercises. Twenty healthy subjects randomly underwent four sessions: control (C:30 min of rest), aerobic (A:30 min, cycle ergometer, 75% of VO(2) peak), resistance (R:6 exercises, 3 sets, 20 repetitions, 50% of 1 RM), and concurrent (AR: A + R). Before and after the interventions, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and HR variability were measured. Systolic BP decreased after all the exercises, and the greatest decreases were observed after the A and AR sessions (-13 ± 1 and -11 ± 1 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.05). Diastolic BP decreased similarly after all the exercises, and this decrease lasted longer after the A session. CO also decreased similarly after the exercises, while systemic vascular resistance increased after the R and AR sessions in the recovery period (+4.0 ± 1.7 and +6.3 ± 1.9 U, respectively, P < 0.05). Stroke volume decreased, while HR increased after the exercises, and the greatest responses were observed after the AR session (SV, A = -14.6 ± 3.6, R = -22.4 ± 3.5 and AR = -23.4 ± 2.4 ml; HR, A =+13 ± 2, R =+15 ± 2 vs. AR =+20 ± 2 bpm, P < 0.05). Cardiac sympathovagal balance increased after the exercises, and the greatest increase was observed after the AR session (A = +0.7 ± 0.8, R = +1.0 ± 0.8 vs. AR = +1.2 ± 0.8, P < 0.05). In conclusion, the association of aerobic and resistance exercises in the same training session did not potentiate post-exercise hypotension, and increased cardiac sympathetic activation during the recovery period.

The tests were performed in different phases of annual training cycles, which were of different structures in the two sports. Also the workloads were different: in judokas the strength/anaerobic component of the training was essential, while in kayakers aerobic work predominated. The post-exercise increases in plasma testosterone diminished towards the end of the training cycle. During the training cycle, resting and exercise-induced levels of androstenedione diminished in kayakers, and remained unchanged in judokas.

In addition, the acceleration of vagally mediated heart rate (HR) recovery after exercise is one of the functional adaptations of the heart in endurance-trained humans. However, the effect of strength training on HR recovery is unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether postexercise HR recovery accelerates in strength-trained athletes. Methods: Subjects were young strength-trained athletes (ST; N = 12), endurance-trained athletes (ET; N = 12), and age-matched sedentary control men (C; N = 12). HR and oxygen uptake were measured during submaximal exercise (cycling exercise, 40 % maximal oxygen uptake for 8 min) and 30 s after the exercise (the postexercise period). Results: Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was higher in both types of athletes compared with C, but greater in ET than in ST (C, 4.3 +/- 0.1 cm; ET, 5.0 +/- 0.1 cm; ST, 4.8 +/- 0.1 cm). Left ventricular average wall thickness was greater in ST in comparison with ET, although it was higher in both trained men compared with C (C, 0.85 +/- 0.02 cm; ET, 0.90 +/- 0.02 cm; ST, 1.00 +/- 0.02 cm). The time constant of postexercise HR decay, an index of vagally mediated postexercise HR recovery, was lower in ST and ET compared with C (C, 94.4 +/- 9.2 s; ET, 65.9 +/- 4.3 s; ST, 69.1 +/- 4.0 s). Oxygen pulse was greater in ST and ET than in C (C, 9.4 +/- 0.6 mL per beat; ET, 13.0 +/- 0.9 mL per beat; ST, 12.8 +/- 0.4 mL per beat), and it results in increased oxygen debt for both types of athletes (C, 0.257 +/- 0.024 L; ET, 0.343 +/- 0.030 L; ST, 0.331 +/- 0.017 L). We did not find significant differences in these indices between ST and ET. Conclusions: These results suggest that the HR recovery immediately after exercise is accelerated in both strength- and endurance-trained athletes.

Current criteria for return to running (RTR) in ACL rehabilitation and the practical considerations of planning strength and conditioning for ACL rehabilitation are also discussed. Collection and review of various articles related to intracellular pathway responses to strength, endurance and concurrent training as well as criteria and/or guidelines for ACL RTR, return to sport (RTS) and reinjury rates. ACL reinjury rates continue to be high despite recent advances in ACL rehabilitation. RTR in ACL rehabilitation marks the transition from impairment-based to functional rehabilitation and also coincides with the change from strength training to concurrent strength and endurance training. The adenosine activate protein kinase (AMKP) intracellular pathway which is activated in response to endurance training inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway which is essential for protein synthesis and development of muscular performance. An additional 'pre-running' phase should be added to ACL rehabilitation programs which focuses on maximum strength, development of muscular power and improving running and landing mechanics. This would allow for strength and performance criteria for RTR to be increased from 70% to 85% of the uninjured limb and improve the likelihood of achieving full strength and hypertrophy before RTS.

In fact, positive effects of short-term interventions, without any negative side-effects, have been shown repeatedly. However, there is a lack of long-term studies investigating the concurrent development of strength and endurance capacities, and there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the complex mix of strength and endurance training in the daily training plan of elite endurance athletes. In this context, cross-country skiers have shown a unique ability to build up and sustain a relatively large and strong muscle mass whilst, at the same time, having developed some of the highest maximal oxygen uptakes ever measured in humans. Accordingly, this study explores and discusses how world-class cross-country skiers implement strength training in their long-term endurance training schedule. The presented examples provide support to the scientific evidence from short-term studies, with heavy strength training being included approximately two times per week to build up strength in the preparation period and once per week to maintain strength in the competition period. Furthermore, individualized, movement-specific strength programs aiming to improve skiing technique, exercise economy/ efficiency and to delay fatigue is employed. However, the systematic use of core/stabilization exercises by the best skiers has lack of scientific support, which is also the case for the placement of strength sessions within the weekly training puzzle, the order of strength exercises during a session, as well as the influence of mental abilities and technical execution during strength sessions.

For patients entering cardiac rehabilitation, current guidelines recommend tailored exercise training programs based on patient characteristics and rehabilitation goals. Objective This study was to analyze to what extent these patient characteristics are determinants of variations in training programs. Design This was a prospective, observational study with cross-sectional measurements among 10 cardiac rehabilitation centers. Methods The following data were obtained about patients entering cardiac rehabilitation: referral diagnosis, rehabilitation goals, and exercise training variables. Primary outcomes were variations in total aerobic training time, intensity, and volume before and after case-mix correction for population differences between centers. Secondary outcomes were variations in other training characteristics and the role of exercise testing in the determination of training intensity. Also, the roles of diagnosis and training goals in determining aerobic training time and intensity were studied. Results Data from 700 participants were analyzed. There were significant variations between centers in all aerobic and most resistance training characteristics. For aerobic training intensity, time, and volume, great variations remained after case-mix correction. An exercise test was performed for 656 participants (93.7%) but was used to determine training intensity in only 344 (52.4%) of these participants. In most centers, referral diagnosis and rehabilitation goals were unrelated to aerobic training time or intensity. Limitations Some form of selection bias cannot be excluded because the competing centers represented a minority of Dutch exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation centers. Conclusions This study showed that the contents of training programs varied considerably between cardiac rehabilitation centers, independent of population differences.

J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1726–1730, 2022—The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of change in maximal oxygen uptake (ΔV̇ o 2max) in response to a polarized training program. Twenty well-trained mountain bike cyclists completed an 8-week intervention of sprint interval training (SIT) (8–16 30-second maximal sprints), high-intensity interval training (4–6 bouts at 85–95% maximal aerobic power), and endurance training (2–3 hours cycling at 70–80% power at the ventilatory threshold). An incremental exercise test was performed to determine preintervention and postintervention maximal oxygen uptake (V̇ o 2max) and maximal pulmonary ventilation (VEmax) normalized to lean body mass (LBM). The frequency and time domain of heart rate variability (HRV) was also determined during recovery after moderate warm-up in the first and last SIT. Training status was quantified as the total distance cycled in the previous year. V̇ o 2max, VEmax, and the root mean square of the successive differences of normal-to-normal time interval between heartbeats (RMSSD), which is the time domain of HRV all increased significantly. Multiple significant correlations were observed between ΔV̇ o 2max and training status and baseline measures of VEmax·LBM−1, RMSSD, and V̇ o 2max·LBM−1 and a regression equation was developed (r = 0.87, r 2 = 0.76; p = 0.0001). The change in V̇ o 2max in response to polarized training can be predicted with high accuracy based on several measurable variables.

Predicting marathon performance time throughout the training preparation in recreational runners. J Strength Cond Res 35(11): 3218–3224, 2021—The objective of this study was to predict marathon performance at different time points along the season using different speeds derived from ventilatory thresholds and running economy (RE). Sixteen recreational runners (8 women and 8 men) completed a 16-week marathon training macrocycle. Aerobic threshold (AeT), anaerobic threshold (AnT), and maximal oxygen uptake were assessed at the beginning of the season, whereas speeds eliciting training zones at AeT and AnT, and RE were evaluated at 5-time points during the season (M1–M5). Analyses of variance and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. Training improved AeT and AnT speeds at M2 vs. M1 (p = 0.001) and remained significantly higher at M3, M4, and M5 (p = 0.001). There was a significant effect of time (p = 0.003) for RE, being higher at M4 and M5 compared with M1 and M3. Significant correlations were found between marathon performance and speeds at AeT and AnT at every time point (r = 0.81–0.94; p < 0.05). Speed at AnT represented the main influence (65.9 and 71.41%) in the final time prediction at M1 and M2, whereas speed at AeT took its place toward the end of the macrocycle (76.0, 80.4, and 85.0% for M3, M4, and M5, respectively). In conclusion, assessment of speeds at AeT and AnT permits for reasonable performance prediction during the training preparation, therefore avoiding maximal testing while monitoring 2 fundamental training speeds. Future research should verify if these findings are applicable to runners of different levels and other periodization models.

In this paper, we take the endurance training load features of Nordic combined athletes preparing for the 2021-22 FIS Nordic Combined Continental Cup as the research subject. The analysis is carried out to explore the features and physiological adaptation mechanism for Nordic combined training, with a view to providing theoretical support for future preparation for Nordic combined. Research findings: 1) The training volume during the entire cycle was 614 km, with an average of 102.3 km/week. The highest training volume was 180 km in the 3rd week before the competition, and the lowest was 55 km in the 1st week before the competition; 2) The training intensity showed a polarized structure 6 weeks before the game and 1 week before the game, and low-intensity training accounted for 71.07%, medium-intensity training accounted for 21.15%, and high-intensity training accounted for 7.78% of the whole training cycle, with interval anaerobic training being mixed with low-intensity aerobic training. 3) In the 6 weeks before the competition, with the increase of training intensity, body weight, body fat rate, body fat gradually decreased; muscle mass, skeletal muscle, and skeletal muscle rate increased and stabilized; but hemoglobin, urea nitrogen, and Cortisol did not change much; testosterone, creatine kinase gradually increased; immune indicators such as white blood cells, lymphocytes, and monocytes gradually decreased, all within the normal range. 4) In training monitoring, aerobic training uses heart rate as a proxy for oxygen uptake (V02), with an emphasis on differentiated training intensity and personalized training through individualized aerobic threshold, anaerobic threshold lactic acid and heart rate.

Aim: Hypoxemia can cause serious illness and therefore we consider it useful to investigate the occurrence of this phenomenon during exercises of strength or endurance. Methods: The preliminary study was conducted on 8 subjects, both trained and untrained. With a Beurer pulse oximeter, heart rate and oxygen saturation of the capillary blood were measured before, during, and at the end of strength, or endurance or endurance combined with strength training. Results: The results have shown that hypoxemia occurs only under the conditions of high intensity training, which alternates endurance with strength exercises, simultaneously with decreasing heart rate, only in trained subjects and with relatively low muscle mass. Conclusions: The decrease in oxygen saturation in the peripheral blood occurs simultaneously with that of heart rate and it seems that large muscle mass has a protective effect on oxygen desaturation.

The objectives of this pilot study were to assess ankle push-off power and walking performance in pwMS and healthy controls, and the preliminary effectiveness of a sequential exercise program (resistance training followed by walking-specific endurance training) on ankle push-off power and walking performance. Methods PwMS (N = 10) with self-reported reduced walking performance and healthy controls (N = 10; at baseline only) underwent 3D gait analysis during a self-paced 12-minute walking test to assess walking performance prior to and following a sequential exercise program. Secondary testing paradigms comprised isometric muscle testing (triceps surae), cardiopulmonary exercise testing and self-report measures. Findings PwMS had a shorter 12-minute walking distance, and lower peak ankle push-off power (most-affected leg) in comparison to healthy controls. There was no minute-to-minute decline in walking performance. The 8-week resistance training significantly improved walking distance. In parallel, higher peak and speed-normalized ankle push-off power were found in the less-affected side. No additional changes were found following the walking-specific endurance training phase. Interpretation There was no walking-related motor fatigue found during a self-paced 12-minute walking test despite reduced ankle push-off power, and self-reported walking problems. Preliminary effects suggest a positive effect of resistance training on walking performance, potentially associated with increases in ankle push-off power, interestingly, in the less-affected leg. The added effect of the walking-specific endurance training remains unclear. Highlights • Positive preliminary effect of resistance training on walking performance • Patients with Multiple Sclerosis had a shorter walking distance, and lower ankle push-off power • Added effect of the walking-specific endurance training unclear • Potentially more profound changes in ankle push-off in the less-affected side • Both the fast-paced 6-minute and self-paced 12-minute walking test may lack construct validity ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=134904689&site=ehost-live"

The accelerated decline in ...O2peak after the age of 65 yr is primarily due to peripheral tissue changes rather than centrally mediated factors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Peripheral Remodeling through Intermittent Muscular Exercise (PRIME) approach, consisting of a low-mass, high-repetition/duration skeletal muscle focused training regimen would provide superior functional benefits in participants older than 70 yr old and at risk for losing functional independence. Methods: In this clinical trial, 107 participants were randomized to 4 wk of either standard aerobic training (AT) or PRIME (phase 1). This was followed by 8 wk of a progressive whole-body aerobic and resistance training (AT + RT) for all participants (phase 2). The major outcome measures were cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption [...O2peak]), muscular fitness (1 repetition maximal strength [1RM]), and physical function (Senior Fitness Test [SFT] scores). Results were analyzed under a per-protocol criterion. Results: Thirty-eight PRIME and 38 AT participants completed the 3-month protocols. ...O2peak, 1RM, and SFT scores all increased significantly after 12 wk for both treatment groups (P < 0.05). However, relative to AT, participants randomized to PRIME demonstrated a greater increase in ...O2peak (2.37 + 1.83 vs 1.50 + 1.82 mL⋅kg-1⋅mm-1, P < 0.05), 1RM (48.52 + 27.03 vs 28.01 +26.15 kg, P < 0.01) and SFT (22.50 + 9.98 vs 18.66 + 9.60 percentile, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Participants experienced greater increases in cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness and physical function when PRIME training was initiated before a combined AT + RT program. This novel exercise approach may be advantageous to individuals with other chronic disease conditions characterized by low functional capacity.

A review of the literature failed to identify a single article which examined the potential physiological adaptations associated with SUP. Aims: The purpose of this study was to profile elite stand up paddle boarders in relation to balance, muscular strength and muscular endurance. Methods: Eight elite SUP's were recruited from the Stand Up Paddle Surfing Association of Australia. Anatomical measures of multifidus cross-sectional area (via ultrasound), postural control under static and dynamic conditions and an isometric test of lumbar extension were performed. Results: Results found no significant differences in height, significantly less mass (p = 0.001) and significantly lower BMI (p < 0.05) than published Australian Bureau of Statistics data. Significantly lower static postural control indicated by increased velocity of sway ((p < 0.01), Eyes Open (EO) = +72.02% Eyes Closed (EC) = +76.34%) and significantly higher levels of dynamic postural control indicated by decreased velocity of sway (p < 0.01, Eyes-Open-Anterior-Posterior instability condition (EOAP) -34.54%, Eyes -Closed-Anterior-Posterior instability condition (ECAP) -35.83%, Eyes Open Medial Lateral instability condition (EOML) -16.91 %, Eyes Closed Medial Lateral instability condition (ECML) -10.42%) were recorded in all but one condition when compared to national level surfers, which we attributed to time spent in the standing position on an unstable surface. Conclusion: These results indicate that stand up paddle boarding may indeed be beneficial for strength and endurance training of the trunk musculature, for balance training for other sports and useful as a rehabilitation tool for musculoskeletal dysfunction.

The optimal characteristics of strength-specific programs include the use of both concentric and eccentric muscle actions and the performance of both single- and multiple-joint exercises. It is also recommended that the strength program sequence exercises to optimize the quality of the exercise intensity (large before small muscle group exercises, multiple-joint exercises before single-joint exercises, and higher intensity before lower intensity exercises). For initial resistances, it is recommended that loads corresponding to 8-12 repetition maximum (RM) be used in novice training. For intermediate to advanced training, it is recommended that individuals use a wider loading range, from 1-12 RM in a periodized fashion, with eventual emphasis on heavy loading (1-6 RM) using at least 3-min rest periods between sets performed at a moderate contraction velocity (1-2 s concentric, 1-2 s eccentric). When training at a specific RM load, it is recommended that 2-10 % increase in load be applied when the individual can perform the current workload for one to two repetitions over the desired number. The recommendation for training frequency is 2-3 dDTwk-1 for novice and intermediate training and 4-5 dDTwk-1 for advanced training. Similar program designs are recommended for hypertrophy training with respect to exercise selection and frequency. For loading, it is recommended that loads corresponding to 1-12 RM be used in periodized fashion, with emphasis on the 6-12 RM zone using 1- to 2-min rest periods between sets at a moderate velocity. Higher volume, multiple-set programs are recommended for maximizing hypertrophy. Progression in power training entails two general loading strategies: 1) strength training, and 2) use of light loads (30-60 % of 1 RM) performed at a fast contraction velocity with 2-3 min of rest between sets for multiple sets per exercise. It is also recommended that emphasis be placed on multiple-joint exercises, especially those involving the total body. For local muscular endurance training, it is recommended that light to moderate loads (40-60 % of 1 RM) be performed for high repetitions (&gt; 15) using short rest periods (&lt; 90 s). In the interpretation of this position stand, as with prior ones, the recommendations should be viewed in context of the individual's target goals, physical capacity, and training status.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-813039&site=ehost-live"

All these factors usually enhance muscle growth by maximizing muscle fiber recruitment and fast-twitch fiber utilization. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation and endurance exercise, such as walking and cycling, can induce muscle hypertrophy and strength gain to different extents for certain muscles (working muscles) and/or age groups. Moreover, the development of muscular fatigue via blood flow restriction in working muscles can enhance the hypertrophic effect. Ensuring greater speed while walking also appears to yield greater strength gain in older adults. However, the addition of resistance exercise to the exercise program of individuals who regularly perform endurance exercise may be effective for maintaining or increasing muscle mass and strength. As the effects of body mass-based resistance training (RT) depend on the relative value of muscle strength to body mass and the muscle size before intervention, RT with external weights would need to be employed for trained subjects. Recent research has demonstrated that low external weight training can induce hypertrophy that is comparable to that induced by high external weight training when each set is performed until lifting failure. Nevertheless, favorable strength gain is achieved when high external load is used. Furthermore, previous studies indicated that higher lifting speed during RT can result in greater strength gain in young adults, although this finding is not always observed in older adults. Hence, it is important to understand the characteristics of each training method to assign the most suitable training program based on the individual's fitness level and goals.

Design: Sixteen elite volleyball players of the first German division participated in a training study. Methods: The participants were randomly assigned to either the RT+P training group (n =8) or the EMS+P training group (n =8). Both groups participated in a 5-week lower extremity exercise program. Pre and post tests included squat jumps (SJ), countermovement jumps (CMJ), and drop jumps (DJ) on a force plate. The three-step reach height (RH) was assessed using a custom-made vertec apparatus. Fifteen m straight and lateral sprint (S15s and S15l) were assessed using photoelectric cells with interims at 5m and 10m. Results: RT+P training resulted in significant improvements in SJ (+2.3%) and RH (+0.4%) performance. The EMS+P training group showed significant increases in performance of CMJ (+3.8%), DJ (+6.4%), RH (+1.6%), S15l (−3.8%) and after 5m and 10m of the S15s (−2.6%; −0.5%). The comparison of training-induced changes between the two intervention groups revealed significant differences for the SJ (p =0.023) in favor of RT+P and for the S15s after 5m (p =0.006) in favor of EMS+P. Conclusions: The results indicate that RT+P training is effective in promoting jump performances and EMS+P training increases jump, speed and agility performances of elite volleyball players.

It was initially proposed that satellite cell proliferation and differentiation were only required to support resistance exercise-induced hypertrophy. However, satellite cells may also play a role in muscle fibre remodelling after endurance-based exercise and extracellular matrix regulation. Given the importance of dietary protein, particularly branched chain amino acids, in supporting myofibrillar and mitochondrial adaptations to both resistance and endurance-based training, a greater understanding of how protein intake impacts satellite cell activity would provide further insight into the mechanisms governing skeletal muscle remodelling with exercise. While many studies have investigated the capacity for protein ingestion to increase post-exercise rates of muscle protein synthesis, few investigations have examined the role for protein ingestion to modulate satellite cell activity. Here we review the molecular mechanisms controlling the activation of satellite cells in response to mechanical stress and protein intake in both in vitro and in vivo models. We provide a mechanistic framework that describes how protein ingestion may enhance satellite activity and promote exercise adaptations in human skeletal muscle.

Methods: Using a randomized crossover design, eight healthy males were assigned to experimental trials consisting of resistance exercise ( 8 x 5 leg extension, 80% 1RM) followed by cycling (30 min at approximately 70% VO2peak) with either postexercise protein (PRO, 25-g whey protein) or placebo (PLA) ingestion. Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest and at 1 and 4 h after exercise. Results: AktSer473 and mTORSer2448 phosphorylation increased 1 h after exercise with PRO (175%-400%, P < 0.01) and was different from PLA (150%-300%, P < 0.001). Muscle RING finger 1 and atrogin-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) were elevated after exercise but were higher with PLA compared with those in PRO at 1 h (50%—315%, P < 0.05), whereas peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha mRNA increased 4 h after exercise (620%-730%, P < 0.001), with no difference between treatments. Postexercise rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis increased above rest in both trials (75%—145%, P < 0.05) but were higher with PRO (67%, P < 0.05), whereas mitochondrial protein synthesis did not change from baseline. Conclusions: Our results show that a concurrent training session promotes anabolic adaptive responses and increases metabolic/ oxidative mRNA expression in the skeletal muscle. PRO ingestion after combined resistance and endurance exercise enhances myofibrillar protein synthesis and attenuates markers of muscle catabolism and thus is likely an important nutritional strategy to enhance adaptation responses with concurrent training.

Sedentary males (n = 26) and females (n = 25), 18–25 years, were randomly assigned to receive a protein (PRO, 42 g/serving) or carbohydrate (CON) supplement twice daily. Strength and body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were assessed at baseline, 3 (3M), and 6 (6M) months. Protein intake was higher in PRO (PRO: 2.2 g/kg; CON: 1.1 g/kg; p <.001). Females in both groups gained similar strength at 3M and 6M in bench press and hip sled. Males in PRO gained more bench press strength at 3M (PRO: 24.6 ± 3.2 kg; CON: 14.3 ± 3.8 kg; p =.06) and 6M (PRO: 34.4 ± 4.3 kg; CON: 18.7 ± 5.1 kg; p =.03) and hip sled strength at 3M (PRO: 67.7 ± 9.2 kg; CON: 40.8 ± 10.8 kg, p =.07) and 6M (PRO: 94.0 ± 10.6 kg; CON: 65.1 ± 12.4 kg; p =.09) compared with CON. Females in PRO experienced a greater reduction in fat mass over the course of the study (6M) than CON (PRO: −1.7 ± 0.5 kg; CON: 0.1 ± 0.5 kg; p =.06). Changes in lean mass were similar for females in PRO and CON. Loss in fat mass was similar for males in PRO and CON at 3M and 6M.

"Quantifying training intensity distribution in elite endurance athletes: is there evidence for an “optimal” distribution?","Seiler, K.

Eleven male athletes performed treadmill tests to exhaustion to determine heart rate and VO2 corresponding to ventilatory thresholds (VT1, VT2), maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), and maximal heart rate. VT1 and VT2 were used to delineate three intensity zones. During the same time period, all training sessions ( N=384, 37 strength training, 347 endurance) performed over 32 consecutive days were quantified using continuous heart rate registration and session Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). In addition, a subset of 60 consecutive training sessions was quantified using blood lactate measurements. Intensity distribution across endurance training sessions ( n=318) was similar when based on heart rate analysis (75±3%, zone 1; 8±3%, zone 2; 17±4%, zone 3) or session RPE (76±4%, zone 1; 6±5%, zone 2; 18±7%, zone 3). Similarly, from measurements of 60 consecutive sessions, 71% were performed with ≤2.0 mM blood lactate, 7% between 2 and 4 mM, and 22% with over 4 mM (mean=9.5±2.8 mM). In this group of nationally competitive junior skiers, training was organized after a polarized pattern, with most sessions performed clearly below (about 75%) or with substantial periods above (15–20%) the lactate accommodation zone, which is bounded by VT1 and VT2. The pattern quantified here is similar to that reported in observational studies of elite endurance athletes across several sports. It appears that elite endurance athletes train surprisingly little at the lactate threshold intensity.

Ten men (26.1 ± 10.2 years) and 10 women (22.2 ± 1.8 years), habituated to both aerobic and resistance training, performed 3 × 30 minutes aerobic training bouts on the cycle ergometer at intensities of 56%, 71%, and 83% VO2 peak and then rated the global intensity using the session RPE technique (e.g., 0-10) 30 minutes after the end of the session. They also performed 3 3 30 minutes resistance exercise bouts with 2 sets of 6 exercises at 50% (15 repetitions), 70% (10 repetitions), and 90% (4 repetitions) of 1 repetition maximum (1RM). After each set the exercisers rated the intensity of that exercise using the RPE scale. Thirty minutes after the end of the bout they rated the intensity of the whole session and of only the lifting components of the session, using the session RPE method. The rated intensity of exercise increased with the %VO2 peak and the %1RM. There was a general correspondence between the relative intensity (%VO2 peak and % 1RM) and the session RPE. Between different types of resistance exercise at the same relative intensity, the average RPE after each lift varied widely. The resistance training session RPE increased as the intensity increased despite a decrease in the total work performed (p < 0.05). Mean RPE and session RPE-lifting only also grew with increased intensity (p < 0.05). In many cases, the mean RPE, session RPE, and session RPE-lifting only measurements were different at given exercise intensities (p < 0.05). The session RPE appears to be a viable method for quantitating the intensity of resistance training, generally comparable to aerobic training. However, the session RPE may meaningfully underestimate the average intensity rated immediately after each set.

In presenting a strong body of recent research which demonstrably challenges these perceptions we suggest alternate hypotheses towards physiological adaptation which is hinged more upon the effort than the exercise modality. Practical implications of this interpretation of exercise adaptation might effect change in exercise adherence since existing barriers to exercise of time, costs, specialized equipment, etc. become nullified. In presenting the evidence herein we suggest that lay persons wishing to attain the health and fitness (including strength and muscle hypertrophy) benefits of exercise can choose from a wide range of potential exercise modalities so long as the effort is high. Future research should consider this hypothesis by directly comparing RE and AE for acute responses and chronic adaptations.

Current evidence supports a 10% per decade decline in V-dotO[sub 2max] in men and women regardless of activity level. High-intensity exercise may reduce this loss by up to 50% in young and middle-aged men, but not older men, if maintained long term. Middle-aged and older women do not appear to be able to reduce loss rates in V-dotO[sub 2max] to less than 10% per decade, which may be related to estrogen status. However, maintaining high-intensity training seems limited to approximately one decade at best and to a select few individuals. While the factors limiting the ability to maintain high-intensity training are not completely known, aging most likely plays a role as studies have demonstrated that training maintenance becomes more difficult with advancing age. Age-related loss of V-dotO[sub 2max] seems to occur in a non-linear fashion in association with declines in physical activity. In sedentary individuals, this non-linear decline generally occurs during the twenties and thirties whereas athletic individuals demonstrate a non-linear decline upon decreasing or ceasing training. Non-linear loss rates are also demonstrated in individuals over the age of 70 years. The decline in V-dotO[sub 2max] seems to be due to both central and peripheral adaptations, primarily reductions in maximal heart rate (HR[sub max]) and lean body mass (LBM). Exercise training does not influence declines in HR[sub max], while LBM can be maintained to some degree by exercise. Recommendations for exercise training should include aerobic activities utilising guidelines established by the American College of Sports Medicine for improving CV fitness and health, as well as strength training activities for enhancing LBM.

Active lifestyle can slow, stop and even reverse the process of atherosclerosis. In this regard, it is known that increasing the inactivity of a 35% risk of developing hypertension, and subjects who are in poor physical condition are 52% greater risk of the disease than those who are in good shape (Sharkey & Gaskill, 2008). The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in body composition of women dealing with the combined group fitness programs compared to women who engaged in practicing the Pilates method. Methods: The sample consisted of females aged 30 to 50 years. The total sample in the study consisted of 130 subjects from the territory of Novi Sad. Physically active group consisted of 84 respondents, who were divided into two groups. The first group includes 34 women who exercised twice weekly Pilates for a period of one hour, for a period of one year. The second group consisted of 50 subjects who actively exercised at a fitness club ""World Class,"" at least a year, combining a variety of group programs, at least three times a week. The range of training duration was from 30 to 60 minutes. The third group consisted of a sample of 46 subjects who did not engage in any physical activity. Results: The results it was concluded that the subjects who were involved in the combined training group have lower values of body mass index, fat mass and percentage fat mass in total body composition of women who exercised only one group program, or Pilates, and women who not engage in any recreational activity. Discussion: In current practice were determined effects of aerobics on morphological characteristics and functional abilities of trainees have, where they are statistically significant differences in body mass index and fat mass in favor of a person dealing with aerobics, which is the more common form of recreational exercise (Stojiljkovic et al, 2005). Regarding the influence of Pilates exercise on body composition, the results are divided.

Recovery patterns in electroencephalographic global field power during maximal isometric force production. J Strength Cond Res 25(10): 2818-2827, 2011-In previous work, cortical activity decreased with fatigue following novel movements or small muscle group actions. These muscle actions, however, do not appear related to the cortical activity seen with biologically relevant and highly trained movement patterns (i.e., ingrained patterns). The cortical recovery response to ingrained patterns-and how it differs with altered load, speed, or volume - is unknown. The purpose of this balanced, within-group study was to investigate differences in cortical activity 24 hours after physically distinct variations of a highly trained squat exercise (n = 7, minimum 4 years resistance training experience). Four resistance protocols were chosen: rate of force development (PWR, 6 x 3 squat jumps at 30% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]); magnitude of force development (FOR, 6 x 3 squat at 95% of 1RM); volume of force development (VOL, 6 x 10 squat at 80% of their 1RM); and control (CTRL, 6 sets unracking an empty bar). Twenty-four hours later, subjects performed a peak isometric squat while electroencephalographic and biochemical markers of exertion and fatigue were obtained. Global field power detected the quantity of activity superficial to motor regions. Waveforms of activity throughout the isometric squats were obtained and grand averages calculated to produce quantitative depictions of cortical activity. Significance was P <= 0.05. Peak isometric squat force was not statistically different 24 hours postexercise (Force [N]: PWR: 2828.79 ± 461.17; FOR: 2887.64 ± 453.09; VOL: 2910.17 ± 625.81; CTRL 2768.53 ± 374.85). Subjects produced similar and characteristic cortical activity patterns during isometric squats despite varying indices of fatigue. Differences were observed based upon the use or nonuse of aerobic endurance exercise in their training program. Patterns of activity in data seem to have emerged based on differences in training preference. Global Field Power (uV) during the isometric squat for PWR was 26.98 ± 14.64; FOR 24.06 ± 19.05; VOL 23.05 ± 13.37; and CTRL 15.78 ± 8.11. Previous research suggests that cortical activity decreases with physical activity; however, despite substantial endocrine, perceptual, and biomechanical differences between protocols, cortical activity was not decreased below control during the performance of a maximal isometric squat 24 hours after various exercise protocols.

This places young adults at an increased risk for numerous chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular, and/or pulmonary diseases. Objectives: This study aimed to determine if concurrent aerobic and resistance calisthenic training could reduce cardiopulmonary disease risk in young adults in a low resource setting. Methods: Thirty young adult males were randomly assigned to either a six-week non-exercising control group (NON) or concurrent aerobic or resistance traininggroup(CON) thatengaged in three, non-consecutive, 60-minute exercise sessions using a combination of 4 - 5 progressive resistance training exercises for two sets of 15 - 20 repetitions and 30 minutes of aerobic exercises at a rating of perceived exertion of 9 - 15. This study assessed anthropometry (body mass, stature, body mass index waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-stature ratio, sumof skinfolds, percentage body fat, fat mass, fat free mass and conicity index) and lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in one second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), maximal expiratory flow at 75% (MEF75%), maximal expiratory flow at 50% (MEF50%) and maximal expiratory flow at 25 (MEF25%). Results: Concurrent training resulted in significant (P-0.05) improvements in waist-to-hip ratio (0.94-0.04 to 0.92-0.05; P = 0.042), fat free mass (57.46-9.16 to 58.21-8.65 kg; P = 0.018), percentage body fat (14.56-5.96 to 13.24-5.77%, P = 0.006), fat mass (10.22-5.31 to 9.29-5.17 kg; P = 0.008), sum of skinfolds (96.22-35.64 to 87.67-32.15 mm; P = 0.004), PEF (5.06-2.04 to 6.57- 2.51 L; P = 0.018), MEF75% (4.78-2.01 to 6.24-1.99 L.sec-1; P = 0.026), MEF50% (4.08-1.20 to 5.24-1.44 L.sec-1; P = 0.043) and MEF25% (2.66-0.63 to 3.31-1.87 L.sec-1; P = 0.038). Conclusions: The findings support the feasibility and efficacy of a simple and inexpensive concurrent aerobic and resistance training program to simultaneously improve body composition and lung function in an attempt to curb the increasing incidence of overweight/obesity and associated lung dysfunction in young adults in a low resource setting.

The deleterious effects of prolonged bed rest have prompted the liberalization of activity soon after an acute cardiac event. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to provide a 20-24% reduction in total and cardiovascular-related mortality. Adjunctive upper body aerobic exercise and mild to moderate resistance training can improve muscular strength and endurance in clinically stable coronary patients and attenuate the cardiovascular demands of occupational and leisure-time activities. Risk stratification has emerged as the centrepiece of strategies aimed at stabilizing or enhancing the clinical status of post-myocardial infarction patients, as well as vocational counselling. Moreover, randomized controlled trials have confirmed the hypothesis that lipid lowering is associated with, and possibly preceded by, plaque stabilization and a reduction in the risk of recurrent cardiac events.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the explosive strength variables and their relationship with aerobic capacity as a tool to define sports planning strategies. A descriptive correlational study was carried out that included the participation of 6 amateur runners, valued in their aerobic capacity and explosive strength through the 2-kilometer running test and the Squat Jump (SJ), Counter Movement Jump (CMJ) and horizontal feet jump together (SH) respectively. The highest correlation found was between aerobic capacity and SJ jump (p <0.001), which shows that aerobic capacity and muscular strength are fundamental pillars in training and athletic planning, in the same way, the non-existence of a relationship between the SH and the CMJ vertical jump (p = 0.121) allow establishing the practical importance of giving an emphasis to the development of aerobic capacity and specific strength in the horizontal running plane as an optimizing strategy that responds to sports performance in amateur runners.

Relationship between distinct physical capacities in young Welsh rugby players. J Strength Cond Res 36(2): 441–447, 2022—We examined the correlations between aerobic fitness (assessed by the 30-15 intermittent fitness test [IFT]), maximum isometric strength, vertical jump, and speed performance of 37 under-16 (U16) Welsh regional rugby players. The physical assessments used in this research are part of a regional development program under the auspices of the players' development pathway created by the Welsh Rugby Union. The tests were performed in the following order: vertical jumps, isometric midthigh pull, 40-m sprint velocity, and 30-15 IFT. A Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient was used to estimate the magnitude of the relationships between the different physical variables. Overall, we found significant associations between jump height, sprint velocity, maximum isometric strength, and 30-15 IFT performance (r ranging from 0.44 to 0.70). Moreover, strong positive interrelationships were observed between strength, speed, and jump qualities (r ranging from 0.51 to 0.80). Although these findings remain to be established in prospective studies, it seems that U16 athletes are capable of simultaneously improving their aerobic fitness and neuromuscular performance. This can be confirmed by the close correlations between the 30-15 IFT and every neuromechanical parameter reported here. Therefore, practitioners are recommended to use multifaceted training schemes with their young rugby players, including different components of endurance, speed, strength, and power training.

This study examined the relationship between selected body composition and training variables, physical characteristics, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol in eumenorrheic runners. Fifteen women (25.8 plus/minus 0.8 years) running 19.8 plus/minus 1.8 miles per week were studied during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Estradiol and LH were determined by radioimmunoassay. Body composition was measured by hydrostatic weighing. Age, Ponderal Index, and menstrual cycle length (days) were inversely related to estradiol (r=-0.56, r=-0.55, r=-0.52, respectively, p less than 0.05). A significant relationship (R2=0.91; p less than 0.05) was found among age, menstrual cycle length, LH (mIU/ml), VO2max (ml/kg/min), weight training (hr/wk), miles run per week, height (cm), additional aerobic training (hr/wk), relative body fat (percent), and Ponderal Index and estradiol (pg/ml). These data suggest the midluteal concentration of estradiol in moderately trained eumenorrheic runners is the result of a complex interaction of many factors.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH293636&site=ehost-live"

However, to date, different training load indicators are used without a clear link to training outcomes. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to identify the state of knowledge with respect to the relationship between training load indicators and training outcomes in terms of physical fitness, injury, and illness. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in four electronic databases (CINAHL, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science). Training load was defined as the amount of stress over a minimum of two training sessions or matches, quantified in either external (e.g., duration, distance covered) or internal load (e.g., heart rate [HR]), to obtain a training outcome over time. Results: A total of 6492 records were retrieved, of which 3304 were duplicates. After screening the titles, abstracts and full texts, we identified 12 full-text articles that matched our inclusion criteria. One of these articles was identified through additional sources. All of these articles used correlations to examine the relationship between load indicators and training outcomes. For pre-season, training time spent at high intensity (i.e., >90 % of maximal HR) was linked to positive changes in aerobic fitness. Exposure time in terms of accumulated training, match or combined training, and match time showed both positive and negative relationships with changes in fitness over a season. Muscular perceived exertion may indicate negative changes in physical fitness. Additionally, it appeared that training at high intensity may involve a higher injury risk. Detailed external load indicators, using electronic performance and tracking systems, are relatively unexamined. In addition, most research focused on the relationship between training load indicators and changes in physical fitness, but less on injury and illness. Conclusion: HR indicators showed relationships with positive changes in physical fitness during pre-season. In addition, exposure time appeared to be related to positive and negative changes in physical fitness. Despite the availability of more detailed training load indicators nowadays, the evidence about the usefulness in relation to training outcomes is rare. Future research should implement continuous monitoring of training load, combined with the individual characteristics, to further examine their relationship with physical fitness, injury, and illness.

Members of required fitness classes (n=170) were measured after 14 weeks of strength and aerobic endurance training. Anthropometric dimensions included upper arm and chest circumferences, upper and lower arm lengths, shoulder and hip widths, 0 percent fat, and height. Arm muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated from upper arm circumferences corrected for triceps skinfold. Drop distance was measured from the bar to the pectoral muscles. Multiple regression analysis selected upper arm CSA, 0 percent fat, and chest circumference as the best items to predict bench press strength (R=0.83; SEE=11.6 kg). Cross-validation of the prediction equation on a similar sample (n=89) produced an r=0.74 between predicted and actual bench press (t=0.53, p is less than 0.50). In a second cross validation sample (n=57) who had trained more extensively with weights, the correlation between predicted and actual bench press was r=0.57. The prediction equations significantly (t=6.59, p is less than 0.01) underestimated bench press performance in the more extensively weight trained subjects. The results of this study suggest that bench press performance is related to structural dimensions in males and that extensive strength training may alter the relationship between size and strength.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH287439&site=ehost-live"
"Reponses du muscle a l'exercice et recuperation.","Bigard, A.-X.","Science & Sports",="07651597",,="20041001","19","5","246","18","SPHS-1007453",,,"Article","PHYSIOLOGY; MUSCLES; EXERCISE; REGENERATION (Biology); GENETICS",,"Objectives. - The aim of this symposium entitled ""Muscle plasticity and regeneration"" was devoted to put in touch several international scientists on issues that concern skeletal and cardiac muscle, their adaptive responses to physical training, and characteristics of their recovery. Topics. - Professor James Skinner is involved in an extensive study whose objective is to examine the role played by the genetic basis of responses to physical training and of concomitant changes in risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (HERITAGE study). During this study, he showed that expected changes in the maximal oxygen uptake (a marker of the positive responses to training) depended neither on gender, race, age, nor on initial physical fitness. Therefore, all these results clearly suggest that the ""high-responder to training"" phenotype vary according to the interaction between many genes and between these genes and environment. The gene encoding for the angiotensin converting enzyme was one of the potential genes able to account for the high, early and complete response to physical training. Results of the Heritage Family Study were not in accordance with this hypothesis and nothing clearly suggests that the I variant of the human ACE gene was involved in the extent of adaptive responses to repeated exercise. Many studies have been published during these last years, with the purpose to examine the molecular mechanisms that explain, at least partly, the adaptive muscles responses to physical training. Marked and significant advances have been done to explain the molecular and cellular events involved in the training-induced increase in mitochondrial density within skeletal muscle; alteration in the balance of the intracellular energy status is one of the major events involved in the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPkinase activation). AMPkinase activation increases the expression of a transcription factor (PGC-1 alpha PPAR-gamma coactivator-1 alpha) that coordinately controls the expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Endurance training also induces an increase in the muscle capillary bed. This increase is mainly related to an enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor expression (VEGF). Exercise-induced intracellular hypoxia is one major event of VEGF gene expression during exercise. The effects of strength training on skeletal muscle result mainly on changes in muscle mass. Considerable advances have been done to understand the molecular mechanisms and interaction involved in the signalling pathways activated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). On the other hand, inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway could be important to increase muscle size during strength training; a particular attention has been paid on the activation of two enzymes, namely muscle ring finger 1 (Murf1) and muscle atrophy F-box, ou Atrogin-1 (MAFbx) which are required for ubiquitin-ligase activity. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a special and specific physiological-role on the training-induced muscle responses. Prolonged exercise is associated with an increase in plasma IL-6, which results from an enhanced production by skeletal muscle. Production of IL-6 in contracting skeletal muscles can account for the exercise-induced increase in plasma IL-6. An inverse relationship was shown between muscle cytokine production and muscle glycogen availability; muscle-derived IL-6 is released into the circulation during exercise and is likely to exert an effect on the liver and adipose tissue, thereby contributing to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis during exercise and mediating exercise-induced lipolysis. These results indicate that IL-6 may represent an important link between contracting skeletal muscles and exercise-related metabolic changes, and should be viewed as an important biochemical factor to account for the exercise-related metabolic and immune changes, and recovery. Future prospects. - Taken together, these results clearly have a major impact in exercise physiology and muscle biology. They contribute to improve our knowledge on the acute and adaptive muscle responses to changes in workload, and on muscle recovery. Moreover, these researches have a potential impact in the medium term to develop pharmacological treatments and strategies devoted to avoid muscle inactivity.

Participants were 15 sedentary overweight females (age = 28.6 ±12 yrs; BMI = 28.1±7.8) Subjects did a counterbalanced intervention: resistance training (circuit training) first (intervention RT) or aerobic exercise first (intervention AT), while oxygen consumption was continuously measured for 80 min. Subjects performed a warm-up on the treadmill at 40% of their heart rate reserve for 5 minutes, then for 30 minutes did continuous walking or jogging on the treadmill at ∼67% of their predicted maximum heart rate reserve. Immediately following treadmill exercise, subjects performed 25 minutes of resistance exercises including 2 sets of 12 reps at 67% of their 1RM of each exercise. Cool down consisted of five minutes on the treadmill with a gradual decline in speed. The energy used during the AT intervention was 431.2 ± 90.9 kcals compared to the RT intervention 398.3 ± 93.9 kcals. The mean difference was significant, (p =0.003). Based on the results of this study, aerobic exercise preceding resistance training has a greater impact on total energy consumption in females versus the reverse order.

An isoform of the PGC-1α gene, PGC-1α4, is known to promote hypertrophy and strength, hallmark adaptations of RET. However, other metabolic effects of PGC-1α4 in response to RET in skeletal muscle are unknown. PURPOSE: Toinvestigate the roles of PGC-1α4 and RET on glycolytic metabolism regulation in skeletal muscle. METHODS: Muscle biopsies were obtained from male and female subjects before and after a single resistance exercise session (RE) and before and after 12 weeks of RET in young and older subjects. Activity of key glycolytic enzymes was measured using kit assays, and mRNA expression of PGC-1α isoforms was measured by qPCR. PGC-1α isoform protein abundance was measured by immunoblotting. In other experiments using C2C12 myotubestransfected with adenovirus overexpressing PGC-1α4 or anempty vector we measured glucose uptake, glycolysis,glycolytic capacity, and the expression of key glycolytic proteins. RESULTS: We observed elevated activity of hexokinase (2.0 ± 0.3 nmol/mg/min) and phosphofructokinase (82 ± 22 nmol/mg/min) after RE (P<0.05), and elevated hexokinase activity (0.9 ± 0.3 nmol/mg/min) after RET (P<0.05). mRNA expression of PGC-1α4 was increased after RE (P<0.05), but PGC-1α4 protein expression was only increased following RET. In myotubes overexpressing PGC-1α4, glucose uptake was increased by nearly 2-fold (P<0.05), concomitant with increased glycolysis and glycolytic capacity (P<0.05).PGC-1α4 overexpression also resulted in a robust increase in the expression of multiple glycolytic proteins (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that PGC-1α4 regulates glycolytic metabolism.Important next steps will be to 1) identify if PGC-1α4 is required for the RET effect on glycolysis, and 2) determine if RET-mediated improvements in glycolysis are critical for enhancing insulin sensitivity.

However, the site of interaction and the mechanisms are unclear. We have investigated the hypothesis that molecular signaling of mitochondrial biogenesis after endurance exercise is impaired by resistance exercise. Ten healthy subjects performed either only endurance exercise (E; 1-h cycling at ~65% of maximal oxygen uptake), or endurance exercise followed by resistance exercise (ER; 1-h cycling + 6 sets of leg press at 70-80% of 1 repetition maximum) in a randomized cross-over design. Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after exercise (1 and 3 h postcycling). The mRNA of genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis [(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 (PGC-l)α, PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC)] related coactivator) and substrate regulation (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4) increased after both E and ER, but the mRNA levels were about twofold higher after ER (P < 0.01). Phosphorylation of proteins involved in the signaling cascade of protein synthesis [mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), ribosomal S6 kinase 1, and eukaryotic elongation factor 2] was altered after ER but not after E. Moreover, ER induced a larger increase in mRNA of genes associated with positive mTOR signaling (cMyc and Rheb). Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and Akt increased similarly at 1 h postcycling (P < 0.01) after both types of exercise. Contrary to our hypothesis, the results demonstrate that ER, performed after E, amplifies the adaptive signaling response of mitochondrial biogenesis compared with single-mode endurance exercise. The mechanism may relate to a cross talk between signaling pathways mediated by mTOR. The results suggest that concurrent training may be beneficial for the adaptation of muscle oxidative capacity.

Methods: Twenty-six elite male rowers performed 4 RT sessions within 10 days. At baseline and after the first and fourth RT, EGROSS and NMF were established. From breathing gas, EGROSS was determined during submaximal rowing tests. Using a countermovement jump test, NMF was assessed by jump height, flight time, flight-to-contraction-time ratio, peak power, and time to peak power. Muscle soreness was assessed using a 10-cm-long visual analog scale. Results: No significant differences were found for EGROSS (P =.565, ω2 =.032). Muscle soreness (P =.00, ω2 =.500) and time to peak power (P =.08, ω2 = 0.238) were higher compared with baseline at all test moments. Flight-to-contraction-time ratio, jump height, and peak power after the fourth RT differed from baseline (P <.05, ω2 =.36, ω2 =.38, and ω2 =.31) and from results obtained after the first RT (P <.05, ω2 =.36, ω2 =.47, and ω2 =.22). Conclusions: RT in general does not influence EGROSS, but large individual differences (4.1%–14.8%) were observed. NMF is affected by RT, particularly after multiple sessions. During periods of intensified RT, imposed external load for low-intensity endurance training need not be altered, but rowers are recommended to abstain from intensive endurance training. Individual monitoring is strongly recommended. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=153677488&site=ehost-live"

Thirty-five healthy, active women were randomly assigned to one of four groups that either a) performed 25 min of BSA only (SA25); b) performed a combination of 25 min of BSA and a multiple-set upper and lower body resistance exercise program (SAR); c) performed 40 min of BSA only (SA40); or d) served as a control group (C), only performing activities of daily living. Direct assessments for body composition, aerobic fitness, muscular strength, endurance, power, and cross-sectional area were performed 1 wk before and after 12 wk of training. All training groups significantly improved peak VO2 (3.7 to 5.3 mL O2.kg-1.min-1), with the greatest improvement observed in the SAR group (P = 0.05). Significant reductions in preexercise heart rates (8-9 bpm) and body fat percent (5-6 %) were observed in all training groups after training. Significant reductions in resting diastolic blood pressure were observed for the SAR and SA40 groups (6.7 and 5.8 mm Hg, respectively). Muscular strength and endurance only improved significantly in the SAR group (21 and 11 % respectively). All groups demonstrated increased lower body power (11-14 %), but only the SAR group significantly improved upper body power (32 %). Thigh muscle cross-sectional areas measured via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) increased primarily for the SAR group. BSA is an exercise modality effective for improving physical fitness and body composition in healthy women. The addition of resistance exercise appears to enhance the total fitness profile by improving muscular performances, muscle morphology, and cardiovascular fitness greater than from performing BSA alone. Therefore, the inclusion of both modalities to an exercise program is most effective for improving total body fitness and a woman's health profile.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-672710&site=ehost-live"

Resistance training dose response in combined endurance-resistance training in patients with cardiovascular disease: a randomized trial. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of 2 different volumes of resistance training (RT) combined with aerobic training in residential cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Design: Randomized prospective cohort study. Setting: Center for inpatient CR. Participants: Patients (N=295) with a mean age ± SD of 62.7±11.7 years participated in the study. Interventions: Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups (group 1 and group 2) with different volumes of RT; 2 sets × 12 repetitions (REPS) (group 1) and 3 sets × 15 REPS (group 2) per session, 2 times per week; each RT session consisting of 10 different resistance exercises. In addition, patients also completed continuous moderate intensity aerobic training composed of cycle ergometry 6 times per week for 17±4 minutes (mean ± SD) and walking 5 times per week for 45 minutes. Main Outcome Measures: At entry and after 26±4 (mean ± SD) days of CR, blood pressure, heart rate, maximal oxygen consumption, and maximal power determined during cycle ergometry, strength determined via RT, and blood biochemistries were assessed. Data were analyzed via a 2-way (group × time) repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Statistical analysis revealed equivalent improvements in exercise capacity, muscular strength, hemodynamics, and blood chemistries regardless of RT volume (comparison-wise type I error rate, α<.01). Conclusions: Our results show that nearly doubling (3 sets × 15 REPS vs 2 sets × 12 REPS) the volume of RT as part of a residential CR program does not yield further improvement in strength and cardiovascular risk factors.

Many improvements in physical function and athletic performance are associated with the increases in muscle strength, power, endurance, and hypertrophy observed during resistance training. The key element to effective resistance training is supervision by a qualified professional and the proper prescription of the program variables.

The purpose of this brief review is to discuss whether or not RT enhances VOmax in young (20-40 years) and older subjects (>60 years). Only 3 of 17 studies involving young subjects have indicated significant increases in VOmax following RT, while six of nine studies in older subjects have reported significant improvements in VOmax following RT. There was a significant negative correlation between the initial VOmax and RT-induced change in VOmax. This result suggests that RT-induced increase in VOmax is dependent upon the subject's initial VOmax. The RT-induced increase in VOmax may be elicited when their initial relative VOmax is lower than 25 ml/kg/min for older subjects and lower than 40 ml/kg/min for young subjects. Thus, RT can be expected to improve concurrently both muscular and cardiovascular fitnesses within a single mode of RT when young and old persons have initially low fitness levels.

The present study compared different training regimes with respect to muscle strength, muscle fiber size, muscle architecture, and stair walking power in elderly postoperative patients. Thirty-six patients (60-86 yr) scheduled for unilateral hip replacement surgery due to hip osteoarthritis were randomized to either 1) resistance training (RT: 3/wk × 12 wk), 2) electrical stimulation (ES: 1 h/day × 12 wk), or 3) standard rehabilitation (SR: 1 h/day × 12 wk). All measurements were performed at baseline, at 5 wk and 12 wk postsurgery. After 12 wk of resistance training, maximal dynamic muscle strength increased by 30% at 60°/s (P < 0.05) and by 29% at 180°/s (P < 0.05); muscle fiber area increased for type I (+ 17%, P < 0.05), type ha (+37%, P < 0.05), and type IIa muscle fibers (+51%, P < 0.05); and muscle fiber pennation angle increased by 22% and muscle thickness increased by 15% (P < 0.05). Furthermore, stair walking power increased by 35% (P < 0.05) and was related to the increase in type II fiber area (r = 0.729, P < 0.05). In contrast, there was no increase in any measurement outcomes with electrical stimulation and standard rehabilitation. The present study is the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of resistance training to induce beneficial qualitative changes in muscle fiber morphology and muscle architecture in elderly postoperative patients. In contrast, rehabilitation regimes based on functional exercises and neuromuscular electrical stimulation had no effect. The present data emphasize the importance of resistance training in future rehabilitation programs for elderly individuals.

The aim of the current study, therefore, is to investigate the influence of RT on migraine headache indices, upper and lower-body strength, and quality of life (QOL) in women with migraine disorders. Methods: Twenty female migraine patients who were referred by a neurologist were randomly assigned to two groups including RT group (n = 10) and control (CON) group (n = 10). The RT protocol consisted of 8 weeks, 3 sessions per week, 45–60 min per session. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and pain diary were utilized to measure the subjects' migraine indices including duration, pain severity, and frequency within 48 h pre- and post-training protocol. Patients in the Control group (CON) have been refrained from regular exercise during this study. The quality of life (QOL) and muscular strength were measured by the Headache Impact Tests (HIT) and one-repetition maximum (1RM) test, respectively, for 48 h pre- and post-training protocol. Results: The RT resulted in a significant decrease in the migraine indices (headache intensity, frequency, and duration) (p = 0.02, p = 0.001, p = 0.04, respectivetly). Increased quality of life and chest and leg muscular strength significantly (p = 0.001 for all) were also showed after 8-week RT protocol. However, there were not any significant differences between groups considering, BMI and waist-hip ratio (WHR) after executing RT protocol (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Based on the results of the current study that mainly had a positive trend, it could state that RT protocol with special consideration for migraine patients is probably an alternative therapy or augmentative complement to established interventions for migraine treatment.

"Responses Of Serum IGF-1 After An Acute Bout Of Lower-Body Resistance Exercise.","Campbell, Bill I; La Bounty, Paul; Oetken, Austin; Greenwood, Mike; Kreider, Richard; Willoughby, Darryn","Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research",="10648011",,="20100102","24",,"1","1","113578905",,,"Abstract","ISOMETRIC exercise; DIETARY supplements; PHYSIOLOGICAL effects of arginine",,"The acute response of IGF-1 to resistance exercise remains unclear. Most studies have shown no change in IGF-1 during or immediately following an acute bout of resistance exercise, whereas a few studies have shown acute elevations during and following resistance exercise. To determine the serum free IGF-1 response to an acute bout of intense, lower body resistance exercise. Ten healthy and physically active males (21±2.4yrs, 83±11.2kg, 176.8±7.7cm) engaged in an acute bout of lower body RE which consisted of four sets of both leg press and leg extension at 80% 1RM to failure. Rest periods between sets and exercises were approximately 150 seconds. Immediately prior to the resistance exercise bout, but following an 8-12 hour fast, participants underwent an initial/baseline blood draw. Blood was also obtained immediately, 30 minutes, two and six hours after the resistance exercise bout. Serum free- IGF-1 was analyzed via ELISA [Active® Bioactive ELISA by Diagnostic Systems Laboratories Inc. (DSL-10-9400; Webster, TX)]. A one-way ANOVA with repeated measures was utilized to analyze the data. Following the ANOVA, a series of paired-samples t-tests (one for each time point compared to baseline values) was conducted. Data are presented as means ± standard deviation utilizing ng/ml as the units of measurement. Baseline free IGF-1 = 1.2 ± 0.43 ng/ml. Following exercise, free IGF-1 concentrations were 1.6 ± 0.54; 1.5 ± 0.57; 1.4 ± 0.46; and 1.1 ± 0.53 ng/ml immediately post, 30 minutes, 2 hrs, and 6 hours post exercise, respectively. The ANOVA analysis indicated a significant difference across time for IGF-1 (p < .001). Subsequent paired-samples t-tests revealed a significant difference between the baseline and immediate post-resistance exercise IGF-1 levels (p = .001). Statistical trends were observed between baseline and 30 minutes post-exercise (p = .053) and baseline and 2 hours post-exercise (p = .052). An acute bout of lower-body resistance exercise in which each set is performed to failure significantly increases serum IGF-1 levels. The findings from the present study support those from other studies but are in contrast to others. Possible differences accounting for the discrepancies of the acute IGF-1 response to resistance exercise include training to failure on each set, rest periods between sets, exercise selection, or other variables. More investigations involving the response of IGF-1 to intense resistance exercise are needed to further elucidate the responses of this anabolic hormone. Resistance training improves muscular strength, muscular endurance, and increases lean body mass. Serum IGF-1, which increases in response to intense resistance exercise, may be (at least in part) responsible for some of these functional and physical adaptations in skeletal muscle.

"Rest Interval between Sets in Strength Training.","de Salles, Belmiro Freitas; Simão, Roberto; Miranda, Fabrício; da Silva Novaes, Jefferson; Lemos, Adriana; Willardson, Jeffrey M.","Sports Medicine",="01121642",,="20090901","39","9","765","13","44256123",,,"Article","PHYSICAL fitness; PHYSICAL education; PHYSICAL fitness -- Research; REST; MUSCULAR sense; PHYSIOLOGY",,"Strength training has become one of the most popular physical activities for increasing characteristics such as absolute muscular strength, endurance, hypertrophy and muscular power. For efficient, safe and effective training, it is of utmost importance to understand the interaction among training variables, which might include the intensity, number of sets, rest interval between sets, exercise modality and velocity of muscle action. Research has indicated that the rest interval between sets is an important variable that affects both acute responses and chronic adaptations to resistance exercise programmes. The purpose of this review is to analyse and discuss the rest interval between sets for targeting specific training outcomes (e.g. absolute muscular strength, endurance, hypertrophy and muscular power). The Scielo, Science Citation Index, National Library of Medicine, MEDLINE, Scopus, Sport Discus and CINAHL databases were used to locate previous original scientific investigations. The 35 studies reviewed examined both acute responses and chronic adaptations, with rest interval length as the experimental variable. In terms of acute responses, a key finding was that when training with loads between 50% and 90% of one repetition maximum, 3-5 minutes' rest between sets allowed for greater repetitions over multiple sets. Furthermore, in terms of chronic adaptations, resting 3-5 minutes between sets produced greater increases in absolute strength, due to higher intensities and volumes of training. Similarly, higher levels of muscular power were demonstrated over multiple sets with 3 or 5 minutes versus 1 minute of rest between sets. Conversely, some experiments have demonstrated that when testing maximal strength, 1-minute rest intervals might be sufficient between repeated attempts; however, from a psychological and physiological standpoint, the inclusion of 3- to 5-minute rest intervals might be safer and more reliable. When the training goal is muscular hypertrophy, the combination of moderate-intensity sets with short rest intervals of 30-60 seconds might be most effective due to greater acute levels of growth hormone during such workouts. Finally, the research on rest interval length in relation to chronic muscular endurance adaptations is less clear. Training with short rest intervals (e.g. 20 seconds to 1 minute) resulted in higher repetition velocities during repeated submaximal muscle actions and also greater total torque during a high-intensity cycle test. Both of these findings indirectly demonstrated the benefits of utilizing short rest intervals for gains in muscular endurance. In summary, the rest interval between sets is an important variable that should receive more attention in resistance exercise prescription. When prescribed appropriately with other important prescriptive variables (i.e. volume and intensity), the amount of rest between sets can influence the efficiency, safety and ultimate effectiveness of a strength training programme.

A growing number of studies have demonstrated the safety of resistance training in Phase III/IV programs (Phase III - community based, beginning 6-12 wk posthospital discharge; a typical patient would be clinically stable with a functional capacity of greater than or equal to 5 METs; Phase IV - long-term maintenance) and more recently in Phase II (beginning within 3 wk posthospital discharge and lasting up to 3 months). Evidence is consistent that this form of training provokes fewer signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia than aerobic testing and training, perhaps because of a lower heart rate (HR) and higher diastolic pressure combining to produce improved coronary artery filling. The major role of resistance training in heart disease patients is to promote increased dynamic muscle strength. Increases in muscular strength have been associated with increased peak exercise performance, improved submaximal endurance, and reduced ratings of perceived leg effort. Two studies show that resistance training may result in improved self-efficacy for strength and exercise tasks and improved quality of life parameters such as total mood disturbance, depression/dejection, fatigue/inertia, and emotional health domain scores. The data on risk factor modification are somewhat equivocal. Studies on blood lipid profiles have mostly been contaminated by confounders, and the effects on blood pressure (BP) are inconsistent. There are encouraging reports that resistance training may increase glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, independent of changes in body fat or aerobic capacity. Future studies are needed in patients with congestive heart failure and orthotopic heart transplanatation; muscle weakness is common in these groups and makes them excellent candidates to benefit from this form of exercise.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-18071&site=ehost-live"

METHODS: Eleven Division I college rowers (mean ± SD 21.4 ± 3.7 y) completed 6 testing sessions throughout the course of their competition season. Testing included measurements of fat mass, bone-free lean mass (BFLM), body fat (%BF), lumbar-spine BMD, and 2000-m time-trial performance. After preseason testing, rowers participated in a periodized training program, with the addition of resistance training to the traditional aerobic-training program. RESULTS: Significant (P < .05) improvements in %BF, total mass, and BFLM were observed at midseason and postseason compared with preseason. Neither lumbar-spine BMD nor BMC significantly changed over the competitive season (P > .05). Finally, rowing performance (as measured by 2000-m time and average watts achieved) significantly improved at midseason and postseason compared with preseason. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the efficacy of a seasonal concurrent training program serving to improve body composition and rowing performance, as measured by 2000-m times and average watts, among college-level rowers. Our findings offer practical applications for coaches and athletes looking to design a concurrent strength and aerobic training program to improve rowing performance across a season.

Seasonal effects of strength endurance vs. power training in young female soccer athletes. J Strength Cond Res 35(12S): S90–S96, 2021—This study examined the seasonal effects of strength endurance training (SET) vs. power training (PT) on physical fitness and body composition in young female soccer players. Thirty-six young female elite soccer players (15 ± 1 years; maturity offset +3 ± 1 years) were allocated to progressive SET (n = 19) or PT (n = 17). Over the course of one soccer season, SET performed slow movement velocity, moderate intensity (50–60% of the 1 repetition maximum [1RM]; 20–40 repetitions) strength exercises while PT performed moderate-to-high intensity (50–95% of the 1RM; 3–8 repetitions), high movement velocity strength exercises (2 sessions·wk−1). Before and after training, tests were performed for the assessment of muscle strength (1RM leg press), jump performance (countermovement jump [CMJ], drop jump [DJ]), muscular endurance (ventral Bourban test), linear speed (10 m, 20 m), change-of-direction (CoD) speed (T-test), dynamic balance (Y-balance test), sport-specific performance (kicking velocity), and body composition (lean body mass and fat mass). An analysis of covariance was used to test for between-group differences at post-test with baseline values as covariate. No significant between-group differences were observed in terms of total training volume over the respective soccer seasons (p = 0.069; d = 0.68). At post-test, SET showed significantly better ventral Bourban and T-test performances (d = 1.28–2.28; p = 0.000–0.001) compared with PT. However, PT resulted in significantly better 1RM leg press, DJ, 10-m, and 20-m sprint performances (d = 0.85–1.44; p = 0.000–0.026). No significant between-group differences were observed at post-test for CMJ, Y-balance test, kicking performance, and body composition (d = 0.20–0.74, p = 0.051–0.594). Our findings are mainly in accordance with the principle of training specificity. Both SET and PT are recommended to be implemented in young female elite soccer players according to the respective training period.

Seventy-four men aged 20-45 were randomly assigned to training (n=52) and control (n=22) groups. Training group underwent 20-week progressive strength training. Body composition and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) during knee extension were measured before and after intervention. Fasting blood samples were analysed for haematocrit (Hct), count of red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb), mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and mean cell volume (MCV) at baseline, 10-week and 20-week follow-up. MVC and lean body mass increased in the training group. Hct, Hb and MCHC showed seasonal variation in the control group. The training group increased their Hct from 44.7 ± 2.6% to 45.4 ± 2.5% (p=0.026) while the control group decreased their Hct from 44.3 ±2.2% to 43.1 ± 2.6% (p=0.037) after 20-week intervention. By contrast to the control group, the training group increased their Hct (p=0.001), RBC (p=0.005) and decreased their MCHC (p < 0.001) from 10-week to 20-week follow-up. We concluded that strength training could affect seasonal variation patterns of red cell variables. Unlike ""sport anaemia"" induced by endurance training, 20-week strength training elevated Hct.

"Seasonal variation of VO2max and the VO2-work rate relationship in elite alpine skiers.","Gross MA; Breil FA; Lehmann AD; Hoppeler H; Vogt M","Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise",="01959131",,="20091101","41","11","2084","6","105338123",,,"Journal Article",,,"Purpose: Alpine ski performance relates closely to both anaerobic and aerobic capacities. During their competitive season, skiers greatly reduce endurance and weight training, and on-snow training becomes predominant. To typify this shift, we compared exhaustive ramp cycling and squat (SJ) and countermovement jumping (CMJ) performance in elite males before and after their competitive season. Results: In postseason compared with preseason: 1) maximal oxygen uptake (V[spacing dot above]O2max) normalized to bodyweight was higher (55.2 +/- 5.2 vs 52.7 +/- 3.6 mL[middle dot]kg-1[middle dot]min-1, P < 0.01), but corresponding work rate (W) was unchanged; 2) at ventilatory thresholds (VT), absolute and relative work rates were similar but heart rates were lower; 3) V[spacing dot above]O2/W slope was greater (9.59 +/- 0.6 vs 9.19 +/- 0.4 mL O2[middle dot]min-1[middle dot]W-1, P = 0.02), with similar flattening (P < 0.01) above VT1 at both time points; and 4) jump height was greater in SJ (47.4 +/- 4.4 vs 44.7 +/- 4.3 cm, P < 0.01) and CMJ (52.7 +/- 4.6 vs 50.4 +/- 5.0 cm, P < 0.01). Discussion: We believe that aerobic capacity and leg power were constrained in preseason and that improvements primarily reflected an in-season recovery from a fatigued state, which was caused by incongruous preseason training. Residual adaptations to high-altitude exposure in preseason could have also affected the results. Nonetheless, modern alpine skiing seemingly provides an ample cardiovascular training stimulus for skiers to maintain their aerobic capacities during the racing season. Conclusions: We conclude that aerobic fitness and leg explosiveness can be maintained in-season but may be compromised by heavy or excessive preseason training. In addition, ramp test V[spacing dot above]O2/W slope analysis could be useful for monitoring both positive and negative responses to training.

Forty-one participants completed a cognitive self-control depletion task (Stroop task) followed by a maximal graded cycling test and were randomized to training (maximal endurance contractions of spring handgrip trainers, twice daily) or no-treatment control groups. At follow-up (2 weeks), half of each group completed either a time-matched or trial-matched Stroop task followed by another maximal graded cycling test. Results showed a significant 2-way (training X time) interaction (P < 0.001), and a trend for the 3-way (training X time X cognitive task) interaction (P = 0.07). Decomposition of the interactions revealed that across sessions cycling performance increased in both training groups, did not change in the trial-matched cognitive task control group, and declined in the time-matched control group. We conclude that isometric handgrip training leads to self-control strength adaptations that enhance maximal cardiovascular exercise performance or tolerance of exercise at maximal levels of effort.

Participants were 54 recreationally trained subjects assigned to either RT or AT groups. During RT, participants performed three sets of 10 repetitions of each exercise at a self-selected intensity (load). After RT completion, participants performed one repetition maximum (IRM) and 10RM tests. During AT, participants performed a treadmill exercise at a self-selected intensity and duration (velocity and time). After AT completion, participants performed a treadmill maximal exercise test using a ramp protocol. During RT, subjects chose an intensity (43.6%-60.2% 1RM) below typical training recommendations, and RPE increased in successive exercise sets. During AT, participants chose an intensity (83.9% Heart Ratepeak) in line with typical training recommendations, and RPE increased from the first to second quartile of the session (from a mean of 3.9, standard deviation [SD] = 1.7 to a mean of 5.4, SD = 1.7; p < .05) and remained stable thereafter. These recreationally trained participants self-selected lower RT intensities than are typically recommended for strength and hypertrophy increases (>67% 1RM) and AT intensities in line with typically recommended intensity (64%-95% HRmax) for cardiovascular fitness increases. Thus, for recreational trained individuals to perform RT at recommended intensities, specific instruction will be required.

This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of motor tests and total quality recovery (TQR) to the training load of microcycles in CrossFit®. Seven female CrossFit® practitioners underwent two sets of three CrossFit® training microcycles: aerobic block (AB) and strength block (SB). On the first and sixth day of the last microcycle of each block, the volunteers performed a series of operative tests. In AB they performed TQR (subjective scale 6 - 20 points), Tapping Test, and KAREN (CrossFit® benchmark); while in SB they performed TQR, Countermovement Jump (CMJ), Bench Press Resistance, and Squat Resistance. The training load of the third microcycle of each block was measured from the RPE obtained 30 minutes after the end of the training session multiplied by the duration of the session. The Pearson correlation test was used for the association between the training load variables (mean and standard deviation) and performance of the operative tests. In SB, squat resistance was significantly correlated with the average training load (r=0.76; p=0.04), and there was a correlation trend between the CMJ test and the standard deviation of the training load (r=0.73; p=0.06). In AB, no operative test correlated with training load variables. In conclusion, the squat resistance test was shown to be sensitive to the average training load in a SF microcycle and can be considered a practical test for monitoring the fatigue-recovery status of CrossFit® practitioners.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in the exercise oxygen uptake and postexercise between two different combinations of resistance training exercises and step choreography, regarding the order of execution. Thirteen active women (30·31 ± 4·42 years, 62·02 ± 5·37 kg, 162·65 ± 4·40 cm, 19·14 ± 3·29% body fat) performed two combinations: step choreography before resistance training, where resistance training was divided into two blocks of analysis (10 min each); and step choreography divided into three equal blocks (10 min for each block), before, in the middle and after resistance exercise. There were significant differences ( P<0·05) between the two sessions in oxygen uptake postexercise in the period of 0-5 min. A significant increase ( P<0·0001) in the oxygen uptake absolute and relative in the heart rate between blocks 1 and 2 of resistance exercise in the two sessions was observed. In the step choreography in blocks, a significant ( P = 0·001) decrease between blocks 2 and 3 in the step choreography before resistance exercise and a significant ( P<0·05) increase in the heart rate in both sessions between blocks were observed. The combination of step choreography and resistance exercises during the same exercise session is a good strategy to promote an elevation of women's oxygen uptake during and after an exercise session, independent of the sequence used.

HVR exercise was conducted on 12 stations of variable resistance hydraulic equipment, four sessions per week for five weeks. Endurance training significantly improved VO2max and submaximal heart rate and blood lactate responses in both groups regardless of the sequence followed. HVR training improved VO2max in group SE only and had no effect on submaximal response to exercise.

Fifty-one untrained overweight/obese males (47 ± 4 years) were divided into a serial combined (SCG), an integrated combined (ICG), or a control (CG) group. The SCG and ICG implemented a 3-month training (3 sessions/week) consisting of walking and body weight exercises. The only difference between SCG and ICG was the sequence of aerobic and strength training. In SCG, the strength training was performed before aerobic training, while in ICG the aerobic and the strength training were alternated repeatedly in a predetermined order. Health, functional capacity, and physical fitness indices were measured before the training, following the termination of programs, and 1-month after training cessation. Following the training, both the SCG and ICG groups showed reduced blood pressure, heart rate, body fat, and waist-to-hip ratio (3–11%; p < 0.001), with improved respiratory function, muscle strength, aerobic capacity, flexibility, and balance (14–61%; p < 0.001). After 1-month of training cessation, significant reductions (p < 0.05) were observed in health indices and physical fitness without returning to baseline levels. However, there were no differences between SCG and ICG after training and training cessation (p > 0.05). In CG, all the above variables did not change. Furthermore, a great percentage of participants in both exercise groups (90%) reported high levels of enjoyment. In conclusion, both serial and integrated outdoor combined walking and body weight strength training programs are enjoyable and equally effective for improving health, functional capacity, and physical fitness indices in overweight/obese middle-aged males.

Therefore, we investigated the effects of three training regimens on serum basal hormone concentrations before and after the 8-wk basic training (BT) period, and whether possible changes in serum basal concentrations are related to changes in endurance and strength performance. Methods: Serum hormone levels were measured in 3 groups of 24 male military conscripts before and after 3 different types of training programs: normal basic training (NT); BT with added strength training (ST); and BT with added endurance training (ET). Results: ET and ST increased their maximal strength by 12.9% and glob, respectively, and their VO2max increased by 12.0% and 8.5%, but the changes did not differ significantly between the groups. Increases in serum basal testosterone concentration were observed in all groups (BT by 16.6%, ST by 16.3%, and ET by 26.6%). Serum basal cortisol concentration increased in ST by 11.1%. Serum basal thyroxine concentration decreased by 9.2% in NT, 11.9% in ST, and 10.5% in ET. Conclusions: The increases in strength, aerobic capacity, and testosterone after training indicate that the regimens were adequate to create positive training responses, especially in the ST and ET groups. On the other hand, unexpectedly low strength gains in the ST group during BT may be a consequence of too high an amount of endurance-based military training.

Methods : Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 T) was used to assess left ventricular (LV) outcomes in 78 untrained subjects (46F, 26 M; 26.1 +/- 5.4 yr). Subjects underwent 3 months of closely supervised and monitored resistance (RES) and endurance (END) training, separated by a 3-month washout period. Results : LV mass (LVM) increased in response to END in both sexes (females [white up pointing triangle]3.98 +/- 7.98 g, P = 0.002; males [white up pointing triangle]5.99 +/- 10.67 g, P = 0.005), whereas LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) increased in males ([white up pointing triangle]7.48 +/- 11.91 mL, P = 0.002) but not females ([white up pointing triangle]1.54 +/- 10.49 mL, P = 0.373). In response to RES, LVM and EDV did not increase in either sex. The proportion of subjects exhibiting a positive response to training (i.e. a change >0) for LVM and EDV did not differ between sexes for either training modality. Conclusion: Eccentric hypertrophy in response to END training was more apparent in males than females, whereas there were no notable cardiac changes between sexes for RES training. The proportion of low versus high responders to training was not sex specific for LVM or EDV in response to either commonly prescribed exercise training modality.

At the statistic analysis of the data that was obtained, descriptive statistics were made. Pre and post-tests of body fat, circumference, lactate and strength 1RM minimum, maximum and average rates were detected. Between their pre and post-tests, some quantitative differences can be seen. As a result, within the 6 weeks training program practiced upon the mountain bikers, strenght, climbing and interval trainings seem to effect their performances positively and the training program can be thought as an example model to those sports scientists who will prepare a study in this field.

All subjects were tested for maximum aerobic capacity, residual lung volume, and maximal pulmonary expiratory pressure before and after the six week jogging program. Analysis of the pretest data indicated an inverse relationship between residual lung volume and maximal expiratory pressure. Posttest results showed that the runners exhibited an increased maximal oxygen consumption, and maximal expiratory pressure while residual lung volume was reduced. These results suggest that reductions with short term aerobic training may be caused by increased strength of the muscles of expiration.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH185941&site=ehost-live"

Moreover, there is increasing evidence that exercise has positive effects on bone structure. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects on bone tissue and muscular strength of a short-term exercise program in osteopenic/osteoporotic postmenopausal women. Methods: Forty-nine osteopenic/osteoporotic postmenopausal women were divided into 2 groups: exercise and control. All subjects underwent 2 evaluations: before and after a training period. Bone quality was assessed by phalangeal quantitative osteosonography, and maximal strength of leg extensor muscles was also evaluated. The experimental group participated in a specific supervised 20-week physical activity program that included aerobic, balance, and strength training. Results: After the training period, all bone parameters and lower-limb maximal strength were significantly improved in the exercise group (P < .05), whereas no significant changes were observed in the control group. Conclusions: Our study showed that a broad-based training protocol, lasting 20 weeks, can improve leg strength and bone quality parameters—main determinants of fall and fracture risk, respectively.

When analyzing the calendar of the International Basketball Federation, it can be observed that international competitions occur in short periods of time. In this sense, the aim of this study was to verify the effects of the application of combined training in the short-term preparation period on the speed of athletes of the Brazilian women's basketball team. Thirteen athletes participated in this study, who took part of the preparation for the 2015 Pan American Games. Athletes were submitted to anthropometric measures and biomotor capacity evaluation at cyclic speed - 20m run, and acyclic speed - T test at the beginning (M0) and end of a 27 - day preparation period (M1). Considering the period available for training, the total duration percentage was: technical / tactical 73.7%, strength and conditioning: 5.7%, preventive: 10.5% and general and special warm up: 10.1%. After data collection, the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify normality and then, the Student's T test was also applied. The main results indicate that the best time to evaluate cyclic speed (M0 and M1, respectively) was 3.34 ± 0.22s and 3.39 ± 0.21s and acyclic speed (M0 and M1, respectively), 9.30 ± 0.49s and 9.52 ± 0.57s. The results of the current study suggest that short-term intervention was not efficient to improve the cyclic and acyclic speed of female basketball athletes.

Seventeen players (19.6 ± 1.6 yrs; 73.8 ± 8.2 kg; 1.77 ± 0.6 m) were divided into two groups based on mean isometric midthigh pull peak force (IPF) (stronger and weaker) and squat jump (SJ) peak power (PP) (higher power and lower power). Eight weaker players were included in the lower power group, while six stronger players were included in the higher power group. Block periodization was adopted to design strength training consisting of 3-week strength endurance and 4-week maximum strength blocks. Performance data included SJ with polyvinyl chloride pipe (SJ0), 20 kgs bar (SJ20), and 40 kgs (SJ40) bar and 20 m sprint across three time points (baseline: TB; post-block 1: T1 ; post-block 2: T2 ). Stronger group showed significant increases from TB to T2 in SJ20 peak power (PP), net impulse, and allometrically-scaled PP (p = 0.005 to 0.01, ES = 0.32 to 0.49). Weaker group demonstrated moderate to large increases from TB to T2 in SJ20, allometrically-scaled peak force (PF), PP, and allometrically-scaled PP (p = <0.001 to 0.04, ES = 1.41 to 1.74). Lower power group showed significant increases from TB to T2 in SJ20 allometrically-scaled PF, net impulse, PP, and allometrically-scaled PP (p = <0.001 to 0.026, ES = 1.06 to 2.01). Weaker and less powerful soccer players can benefit from strength-focused training to improve loaded SJ kinetics associating with force production.

Methods: Twenty-two professional male soccer players were randomly assigned to 2 training groups: vertical strength (VS, n = 11) and vertical and horizontal strength (VHS, n = 11). Players trained 2 times per week during all the preseason (5 wk) and 3 weeks of the competitive season. The effect of the training protocols was assessed using double-and single-leg vertical countermovement jumps (CMJ), half-squat peak power (PP), sprint performance over 5 and 15 m, and blood lactate concentration at selected running speeds. Results: Both groups obtained significant improvements in PP (P < .05; ES = 0.87 and 0.80 for VS and VHS, respectively) and small practical improvements in 5-m- (P < .05; ES = 0.27 and 0.25 for VS and VHS, respectively) and 15-m-sprint time (P < .05; ES = 0.19 and 0.24 for VS and VHS, respectively). The CMJ performance showed a small improvement (P < .05, ES = 0.34) only in the VHS group. Submaximal aerobic-fitness changes were similar in both groups (P < .05; ES = 1.89 and 0 .71 for VS and VHS, respectively). Conclusion: This study provided a small amount of practical evidence for the consideration of preseason training protocols that combine exercises for vertical- and horizontal-axis strength development in professional male soccer players. Further studies using more aggressive training protocols involving horizontally oriented conditioning exercises are warranted.

Methods: Eighteen resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to the following experimental conditions: strength training (ST), strength followed by endurance training (ST-END), or endurance followed by strength training (END-ST). Muscle tissue samples were taken from the vastus lateralis before each exercise protocol, on cessation of exercise, and l h after cessation of strength training. Tissue was analyzed for total and phosphorylated (p-) signaling proteins linked to the mTOR and AMPK networks. Results: Strength-training performance was similar between ST, ST-END, and END-ST. p-S6kl was elevated from baseline 1 h posttraining in ST and ST-END (both P < .05). p-4E-BPl was significantly lower than baseline post-ST (P = .01), whereas at 1 h postexercise in the ST-END condition p-4E-BPl was significantly greater than postexercise (P = .04). p-ACC was elevated from baseline both postexercise and 1 h postexercise (both P < .05) in the END-ST condition. AMPK, mTOR, p38, PKB, and eEF2 responded similarly to ST, ST-END, and END-ST. Signaling responses to ST, ST-END, and END were largely similar. As such it cannot be ascertained which sequence of concurrent strength and endurance training is most favorable in promoting anabolic signaling. Conclusions: In the case of the current study an acute bout of concurrent training of differing sequences elicited similar responses of the AMPK and mTOR networks.

Our objective was to determine whether a dose–response relationship existed between frequency of exercise training and HbA1c change, and whether this varied by exercise modality or participant characteristics. Methods: Post hoc analysis of data from 185 Diabetes Aerobic and Resistance Exercise trial participants with type 2 diabetes randomized to aerobic, resistance or combined training thrice weekly. Dose–response relationships between adherence (percent of prescribed training sessions completed) and HbA1c change were assessed with linear regression. Results: Median overall adherence was 84.9% (interquartile range, 74.4%–93.6%). Higher exercise adherence was associated with greater HbA1c reduction; a 20% increase in adherence (e.g., an additional two sessions per month) was associated with a 0.15% (2 mmol·mol−1) decrease in HbA1c (β = −0.0076, R = −0.170, P = 0.021). Significant dose–response relationships were identified for aerobic (β = −0.0142, R = −0.313, P = 0.016) and combined training (β = −0.0109, R = −0.259, P = 0.041), but not resistance training (β = 0.0068, R = 0.153, P = 0.233). Dose–response relationships in all training groups combined were significant in subgroups younger than 55 yr (β = −0.0113, R = −0.286, P = 0.005), males (β = −0.0123, R = −0.234, P = 0.010), and baseline HbA1c ≥7.5% (58 mmol·mol−1) (β = −0.013, R = −0.263, P = 0.011). Conclusions: There was a dose–response relationship between adherence to prescribed exercise and HbA1c reduction suggesting that glycemic control is improved more in individuals with type 2 diabetes with a higher training volume. Dose–response relationships existed for aerobic and combined training but not resistance training. These findings support aerobic and combined exercise prescriptions outlined in clinical practice guidelines.

Combined training effects might, however, be achieved by performing interval drop jumping. Purpose: To determine the acute effects of interval drop jumping on oxygen uptake ( V ˙ O 2 )—index of cardioventilatory/oxidative stimulation level and peripheral fatigue—a limiting factor of explosiveness. Methods: Thirteen participants performed three 11-minute interval training sessions during which they ran 15 seconds at 120% of the velocity that elicited maximal V ˙ O 2 ( V ˙ O 2 max) (ITrun), or drop jumped at 7 (ITDJ7) or 9 (ITDJ9) jumps per 15 seconds, interspersed with 15 seconds of passive recovery. V ˙ O 2 and the time spent above 90% of V ˙ O 2 max ( V ˙ T O 2 max) were collected. Peripheral fatigue was quantified via preexercise to postexercise changes in evoked potentiated quadriceps twitch (ΔQT). Power output was estimated during ITDJs using optical sensors. Results: All participants reached 90% of V ˙ O 2 max or higher during ITrun and ITDJ9, but only 11 did during ITDJ7. V ˙ T O 2 max was not different between ITrun and ITDJ9 (145 [76] vs 141 [151] s; P =.92) but was reduced during ITDJ7 (28 [26] s; P =.002). Mean ΔQT in ITDJ9 and ITDJ7 was not different (−17% [9%] vs −14% [8%]; P =.73) and greater than in ITrun (−8% [7%]; P =.001). No alteration in power output was found during ITDJs (37 [10] W·kg−1). Conclusion: Interval drop jumping at a high work rate stimulated the cardioventilatory and oxidative systems to the same extent as interval running, while the exercise-induced increase in fatigue did not compromise drop jump performance. Interval drop jumping might be a relevant strategy to get concomitant improvements in endurance and explosive performance.

Sixteen women with metabolic syndrome (MetS) were randomly assigned to perform two combined exercise protocols and a control session ( CON): 1-set, 30 min of aerobic exercise ( AE) at 65-70% of reserve heart rate and 1 set of 8-12 repetitions at 80% of 10- RM in six resistance exercises; 3-sets, same protocol but with 3 sets; and CON, 30 min of seated rest. The SBP, MBP and DBP were measured before and every 15 min during 90 min following the experimental sessions. The SBP displayed a decrease ( P≤0·05) during the 90 min following the RE session with 1-set and 3-set, while MBP was decreased ( P≤0·05) up to 75 min after 1-set and up to 30 min after the 3-set exercise session compared with pre-intervention values. There was a decrease in DBP only for the greatest individual decrease following 1-set (−6·1 mmHg) and 3-set (−4·9 mmHg) combined exercise sessions, without differences between them. The rate-pressure product and heart rate remained significantly higher ( P≤0·05) 75 min and 90 min after the combined exercise session with 1- and 3-sets compared with the CON, respectively. In conclusion, a low-volume RE combined with AE resulted in similar decrease of SBP when compared with RE with 3-sets in women with MetS, which could be beneficial in situations of limited time.

Recreationally active men and women (n 5 42 [f 5 21], 24.4 6 4.4 years) completed 21 sessions over 7 weeks of load-matched and volume-matched low-load resistance training (30% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) with either (a) no BFR (CON), (b) continuous BFR (BFR-C, 60% arterial occlusion pressure [AOP]), or (c) intermittent BFR (BFR-I, 60% AOP). Muscle mass was assessed using peripheral quantitative computed tomography before and after training. Muscular strength, endurance, and power were determined before and after training by assessing isokinetic dynamometry, 1RM, and jump performance. Ratings of pain and effort were taken in the first and final training session. An alpha level of p,0.05 was used to determine significance. There were no between-group differences for any of the morphological or functional variables. The muscle cross sectional area (CSA) increased pre-post training (p 5 0.009; CON: 1.6%, BFR-C: 1.1%, BFR-I: 2.2%). Maximal isometric strength increased pre-post training (p, 0.001; CON: 9.6%, BFR-C: 14.3%, BFR-I: 19.3%). Total work performed during an isokinetic endurance task increased pre-post training (p, 0.001, CON: 3.6%, BFR-C: 9.6%, BFR-I: 11.3%). Perceptions of pain (p50.026) and effort (p50.033) during exercise were higher with BFR-C; however, these reduced with training (p 5 0.005–0.034). Overall, these data suggest that when 30% 1RM loads are used with a frequency of 3 times per week, the addition of BFR does not confer superior morphological or functional adaptations in recreationally active individuals. Furthermore, the additional metabolic stress that is proposed to occur with a continuous BFR protocol does not seem to translate into proportionally greater training adaptations. The current findings promote the use of both intermittent BFR and low-load resistance training without BFR as suitable alternative training methods to continuous BFR. These approaches may be practically applicable for those less tolerable to pain and discomfort associated with ischemia during exercise.

The current investigation tested the hypothesis that a concurrent aerobic and resistance exercise training program would preserve size and contractile function of slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibers. A secondary objective was to test the hypothesis that a leucine-enriched high-protein diet would partially attenuate single fiber characteristics. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained before and on day 59 of bed rest from a control (BR; n = 8), nutrition (BRN; n = 8), or exercise (BRE; n = 8) group. Single muscle fibers were studied for diameter, peak force (Po), contractile velocity, and power. Those in the BR group had a decrease (P < 0.05) in myosin heavy chain (MHC) I diameter (-14%), Po (-35%), and power (-42%) and MHC IIa diameter (-16%) and Po (-31%; P = 0.06) and an increase (P < 0.05) in MHC hybrid fibers. Changes in size and function of MHC I (-19 to -44%) and ha (-21% to -30%) fibers and MHC distribution in BRN individuals were similar to results in the BR group. In BRE conditions, MHC I and IIa size and contractile function were preserved during bed rest. These data show that the concurrent exercise program preserved the myocellular profile of the vastus lateralis muscle during 60-day bed rest. To combat muscle atrophy and function with long-term unloading, the exercise prescription program used in this study should be considered as a viable training program for the upper leg muscles, whereas the nutritional intervention used cannot be recommended as a countermeasure for skeletal muscle.

We investigated skeletal muscle adaptive responses after endurance exercise training (ENT), high-intensity interval training (HIIT), or resistance exercise training (RET), and a subsequent period of detraining, in sedentary, middle-age men. Methods: Thirty-five sedentary men (39 ± 3 yr) were randomized to parallel groups and undertook 6 wk of either ENT (n = 12), HIIT (n = 12), or RET (n = 11) followed by 2.5 wk of detraining. Skeletal muscle fiber characteristics, body composition, muscle thickness, muscle strength, aerobic capacity, resting energy expenditure, and glucose homeostasis were assessed at baseline, and after exercise training and detraining. Results: Lean mass increased after RET and HIIT (+3.2% ± 1.6% and+1.6% ± 2.1%, P <0.05). Muscle strength (sum of leg press, leg extension, and bench press one-repetition maximums) increased after all training interventions (RET, +25% ± 5%; HIIT, +10% ± 5%; ENT, +7% ± 7%; P < 0.05). Aerobic capacity increased only after HIIT and ENT (+14% ± 7% and +11% ± 11%, P < 0.05). Type I and II muscle fiber size increased for all groups after training (main effect of time, P < 0.05). After a period of detraining, the gains in lean mass and maximal muscle strength were maintained in the RET and HIIT groups, but maximal aerobic capacity declined below posttraining levels in HIIT and ENT (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Six weeks of HIIT induced widespread adaptations before detraining in middle-age men. Exercise training-induced increases in aerobic capacity declined during 2.5 wk of detraining, but gains in lean mass and muscle strength were maintained.

However, a close examination of the literature reveals that the interference effect of concurrent exercise training on muscle growth in humans is not as compelling as previously thought. Moreover, recent studies show that, under certain conditions, concurrent exercise may augment resistance exercise-induced hypertrophy in healthy human skeletal muscle. The purpose of this article is to outline the contrary evidence for an acute and chronic interference effect of concurrent exercise on skeletal muscle growth in humans and provide practical literature-based recommendations for maximizing hypertrophy when training concurrently.

Insulin resistance is associated with high levels of stored lipids in skeletal muscle cells. Aerobic exercise training decreases the amounts of these lipid products and increases the lipid oxidative capacity of muscle cells. Thus, aerobic exercise training may prevent insulin resistance by correcting a mismatch between fatty acid uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Additionally, a single session of aerobic exercise increases glucose uptake by muscle during exercise, increases the ability of insulin to promote glucose uptake, and increases glycogen accumulation after exercise, all of which are important to blood glucose control. There also is some indication that resistance exercise may be effective in preventing insulin resistance. The information provided is intended to help clinicians understand and explain the roles of exercise in reducing insulin resistance.

Characterized by abnormal fat reorganization throughout the body, it is one of the most significant effects, involving cardiometabolic risks and impaired body image. Objective: To analyze the somatotype and body image of people living with HIV/AIDS. Methods: The sample consisted of five women (47.8 ± 6.53 years), physically active and in use of HAART . An intervention with concurrent training and dietary counseling was performed, evaluating body shape by somatotype and body image by the scale of silhouettes. Results: There was no difference in the classification of somatotype, however, the results showed a significant difference for the analysis of dispersal distance between somatotypes (DDS) in the 1st week (DDS = 2.63) and 16th week of intervention (DDS = 2.96) when evaluated by means; when evaluated individually, there was a significant difference both in DDS and in spatial distance between somatotypes (DES) in case 1, in the 8th week (DDS = 3.20 and DES = 1.01) and 16th week (DDS = 2.73); and case 3, in the 1st week (DDS = 9.25 and DES = 1.44) and 16th week (DDS = 8.06 and DES = 1.37). In relation to body image, it was observed that the actual image is closer to the ideal image (initial actual image = 6; final actual image = 5, and initial and final ideal Image = 3). Conclusion: The concurrent training program, associated with nutritional counseling, produced positive results in both somatotype and body image perception of the participants, proving its effectiveness in controlling lipodystrophy and improving the body image satisfaction of the evaluated group.

Both the WL and S groups demonstrated a slightly better force-time curve recorded from the leg extensor muscle than the E-group and significant increases occurred in these two groups in dynamic explosive performance during the follow-up. The postpubescent JWL-group demonstrated much greater muscular mass and maximal strength than the prepubescent groups. The present findings demonstrate that specific effects of endurance as well as strength training on physical performance capacity were rather clearly observable among prepubescent athletes, while effects of sprint training did not differ very much from those of strength training.

In clinical practice, there is often an obvious lack of basic knowledge concerning the prerequisites and well established extent of the structural and functional characteristics of an AH. Some misunderstandings arise from the somewhat misleading term ‘athlete's heart’ because not every athlete, even if he or she is training and competing at a very high level, develops an enlarged heart. Such a condition can only be expected after years of quantitative and qualitative demanding aerobic endurance training. Although the correlation with competitive performance of endurance events is rather low in trained athletes, the relationship between heart dimensions and ergometric performance represents an important criterion for differentiation between physiological and pathological cardiac enlargement. The assessment of measures exceeding the usual clinical limits, especially concerning volume-dependent echocardiographic parameters, also requires consideration of the strong influence of anthropometric data. The existence of a concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in strength-trained athletes is still a topic of debate in the literature, but is rejected by most recent well-conducted trials. In our review, only bodybuilders using anabolic steroids exhibited a distinctly higher hypertrophic index compared with all other groups of endurance or strength athletes. Current unsolved issues in clinical sports medicine concern the early detection of myocardial complications in athletes exercising during infectious diseases, and the eligibility for competitive sport in cases of borderline LVH.

Purpose: Exercise and aging may modulate muscle protein homeostasis and autophagy, but few studies examine highly trained middle-age or older individuals. This study elucidated the effects of a new long-term training stimulus on markers of muscle autophagy and unfolded protein response (UPR) and on sprint running performance in masters sprinters. Methods: Thirty-two male competitive sprinters (age 40–76 yr) were randomly divided into experimental (EX) and control (CTRL) groups. The EX training program was a combination of heavy and explosive strength and sprint exercises aimed at improving sprint performance. Fifteen and thirteen participants completed the 20-wk intervention period in EX and CTRL, respectively. The latter were told to continue their routine exercises. Key protein markers were analyzed by Western blotting from vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies. The muscle thickness of VL was analyzed by ultrasonography and sprint performance by a 60-m running test. Results: EX induced improvement in 60-m sprint performance when compared with controls (time–group, P = 0.003) without changes in VL muscle thickness. Content of lipidated microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-II) increased in EX (P = 0.022), suggesting increased autophagosome content. In addition, an autophagosome clearance marker sequestosome 1 (p62) decreased in EX (P = 0.006). Markers of UPR selectively modulated with decreases (e.g., ATF4, P = 0.003) and increases (e.g., EIF2α, P = 0.019) observed in EX. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a new intensive training stimulus that combines strength training with sprint training may increase muscle autophagosome content in a basal state without any evidence of impaired autophagosome clearance in masters sprinters. Simultaneously, the combined training may have a selective effect on the content of UPR signaling components.

Therefore, this study aimed to describe and evaluate the practices used with elite football code athletes to develop sprint performance. Ninety subjects completed a survey comprised of four sections (coaching demographic, evaluation of training, organisation of training, and training protocols). Survey responses showed that 98% of practitioners monitor sprint performance, and 92% integrated monitoring strategies into sprint development programmes to inform training. All practitioners used combined training methods including specific (e.g., sprints with or without overload) and non-specific (e.g., strength training or plyometrics) methods targeting the underpinning determinants of sprint performance. Most practitioners reported prescribing 1–3 or 2–4 days · wk−1 for sprint development, both in-season and pre-season. Sprint development programmes were uncommon in the off-season. Most specific sprint training sessions were reportedly shorter in duration (5–15 and 15–30min) than non-specific sprint training methods (30–45 and >45min) irrespective of the season phases. Sprint development was integrated before and after sport-specific training, regularly using warm-ups and gym sessions. Specific training methods were also implemented in separate sessions. The specific content (e.g., exercise selection, training load prescription) was highly variable between practitioners. This study represents the first detailed survey (practices and justification) of sprint development practices (evaluation and organisation of training protocols) in football code cohorts. These findings present multiple methods of structuring, integrating and manipulating sprint training based on the training aims and the individual context.

Methods: Eleven healthy elderly were trained with NMES for 8 week allocated to combined training (CT: quadriceps and lumbar paraspinal muscles) or to quadriceps training (QT), after completing lifestyle questionnaire and spine morphology measurements. Functional balance, static stabilometry, and isometric strength tests were assessed before and after the training period. Results and conclusion: The CT group showed a greater improve in static balance control, i.e., reducing the CEA of the CoP displacement from 99 ± 38 to 76 ± 42 mm2 (Cohen's d = 0.947). Benefits for improving static balance through CT might be due to NMES training, which increases spinal stabilization.

These methods are classified into two broad categories: a bout of continuous exercise at a given load/intensity and intermittent bouts of exercise at a given load/intensity with recovery intervals. Interestingly, recent work suggests that a training method which starts at a high load/intensity and gradually decreases the exercise load/intensity within a given training set (stepwise load reduction training) may provide a range of adaptations. In resistance training, the load starts off high and is then reduced as the set continues which is expected to simultaneously increase muscle strength, endurance, and size. In training focused on aerobic and anaerobic metabolic systems, intensity starts off high and is then reduced as the exercise continues which is expected to simultaneously increase maximal anaerobic power, anaerobic capacity, and aerobic capacity. Because stepwise load reduction training has no recovery intervals between each load/intensity, the training effects are achieved within a short time per session (several minutes). However, only minimal evidence exists to support the effects of stepwise load reduction training; therefore, further studies with larger samples are needed.

Therefore, the aim of this review is to recommend strategies, based on research, to avoid or minimize any interference effect when training to optimize performance in endurance sports such as rowing and canoeing.

Methods: Thirty physically active women were divided into two groups: resistance training (RT; 72.55 ± 12.58 kg, 153 ± 0.05 cm) and concurrent training (CT; 62.79 ± 8.14 kg; 153 ± 0.06 cm). One repetition maximum (RM) loads for each subject was estimated for leg press 45° (LP45), leg curl (LC) and leg extension (LE) resistance exercises. The training program underwent 20 training sessions (10 weeks) with the frequency of two sessions a week. For the RT group the daily nonlinear periodization was adopted over the 10 weeks following this model: Zone A (70-85% of 1RM), Zone B (85% of 1RM) and Zone C (60-70% of 1RM). In the CT group was adopted the same RT program and also 20-minute of aerobic exercise. Results: Maximum strength (1RM) of the lower-body muscles showed significant increase in RT (P = 0.001) and CT (P = 0.001) groups for the LP45 exercise; and LE (RT: P = 0.002; CT: P = 0.003), respectively, between the pre and post-test measures. Considering the differences between experimental protocols, higher strength gains were found for LP45 (P = 0.001) and LE (P = 0.002) exercises for RT compared to CT protocol. No significant differences were noted for LC exercise between protocols considering also the results intra-group (P = 0.098). Conclusion: Therefore, if the goal of exercise program is to achieve greater strength gains, the RT should be performed isolated than combined with aerobic exercise in the same training session.

Thus, the purpose of this review was 2-fold: to identify strength tests that were reliable and valid correlates (predictors) of rowing performance; and, to establish the benefits gained when strength training was integrated into the physical preparation plans of rowers. The reliability of maximal strength and power tests involving leg extension (e.g. leg pressing) and arm pulling (e.g. prone bench pull) was high (intra-class correlations 0.82-0.99), revealing that elite rowers were significantly stronger than their less competitive peers. The greater strength of elite rowers was in part attributed to the correlation between strength and greater lean body mass (r = 0.57-0.63). Dynamic lower body strength tests that determined the maximal external load for a one-repetition maximum (1RM) leg press (kg), isokinetic leg extension peak force (N) or leg press peak power (W) proved to be moderately to strongly associated with 2000-m er-gometer times (r = -0.54 to -0.68; p < 0.05). Repetition tests that assess muscular or strength endurance by quantifying the number of repetitions accrued at a fixed percentage of the strength maximum (e.g. 50-70% 1 RM leg press) or set absolute load (e.g. 40 kg prone bench pulls) were less reliable and more time consuming when compared with briefer maximal strength tests. Only leg press repetition tests were correlated with 2000-m ergometer times (e.g. r = -0.67; p < 0.05). However, these tests differentiate training experience and muscle morphology, in that those individuals with greater training experience and/or proportions of slow twitch fibres performed more repetitions. Muscle balance ratios derived from strength data (e.g. hamstring-quadriceps ratio <45% or knee extensor-elbow flexor ratio around 4.210.22 to 1) appeared useful in the pathological assessment of low back pain or rib injury history associated with rowing. While strength partially explained variances in 2000-m ergometer performance, concurrent endurance training may be counterproductive to strength development over the shorter term (i.e. <12 weeks). Therefore, prioritization of strength training within the sequence of training units should be considered, particularly over the non-competition phase (e.g. 2-6 sets x 4-12 repetitions, three sessions a week). Maximal strength was sustained when infrequent (e.g. one or two sessions a week) but intense (e.g. 73-79% of maximum) strength training units were scheduled; however, it was unclear whether training adaptations should emphasize maximal strength, endurance or power in order to enhance performance during the competition phase. Additionally, specific on-water strength training practices such as towing ropes had not been reported. Further research should examine the on-water benefits associated with various strength training protocols, in the context of the training phase, weight division, experience and level of rower, if limitations to the reliability and precision of performance data (e.g. 2000-m time or rank) can be controlled. In conclusion, while positive ergometer time-trial benefits of clinical and practical significance were reported with strength training, a lack of statistical significance was noted, primarily due to an absence of quality long-term controlled experimental research designs.

Methods: Three databases were searched, from which 28 of 554 potential studies met all inclusion criteria. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated and weighted by the inverse of variance to calculate an overall effect and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether the strength-training intensity, duration, and frequency and population performance level, age, sex, and sport were outcomes that might influence the magnitude of the effect. Results: The implementation of a strength-training mesocycle in running, cycling, cross-country skiing, and swimming was associated with moderate improvements in middle- and long-distance performance (net SMD [95%CI] = 0.52 [0.33-0.70]). These results were associated with improvements in the energy cost of locomotion (0.65 [0.32-0.98]), maximal force (0.99 [0.80-1.18]), and maximal power (0.50 [0.34-0.67]). Maximal-force training led to greater improvements than other intensities. Subgroup analyses also revealed that beneficial effects on performance were consistent irrespective of the athletes' level. Conclusion: Taken together, these results provide a framework that supports the implementation of strength training in addition to traditional sport-specific training to improve middle- and long-distance performance, mainly through improvements in the energy cost of locomotion, maximal power, and maximal strength.

Results: The endurance strength group significantly improved maximal strength measures at weeks 14 and 26 (P <.05), cycling economy from weeks 0 to 14 (P <.05), and running economy from weeks 14 to 26 (P <.05) with no change in body mass (P >.05). The endurance-only group did not significantly improve any economy measures. Conclusions: The addition of progressive load ST to LD triathletes' training programs can significantly improve running and cycling economy without an increase in body mass.

Elderly women and men (age 71 ± 1, mean ± SEM) were assigned to a group performing 8 weeks of resistance training ( RET, n = 12) or no training ( CON, n = 9). The RET group increased in (i) knee extensor strength (concentric +11 ± 3%, eccentric +8 ± 3% and static +12 ± 3%), (ii) initial (0-30 ms) rate of force development (+52 ± 26%) and (iii) contents of proteins related to signaling of muscle protein synthesis (Akt +69 ± 20 and mammalian target of rapamycin +69 ± 32%). Muscle fiber type composition changed to a more oxidative profile in RET with increased amount of type IIa fibers (+26.9 ± 6.8%) and a trend for decreased amount of type IIx fibers (−16.4 ± 18.2%, P = 0.068). Mitochondrial proteins ( OXPHOS complex II, IV, and citrate synthase) increased in RET by +30 ± 11%, +99 ± 31% and +29 ± 8%, respectively. RET resulted in improved oral glucose tolerance measured as reduced area under curve for glucose (−21 ± 26%) and reduced plasma glucose 2 h post-glucose intake (−14 ± 5%). In CON parameters were unchanged or impaired. In conclusion, short-term resistance training in elderly not only improves muscular strength, but results in robust increases in several parameters related to muscle aerobic capacity.

Nine cyclists performed endurance training and heavy strength training (ES) while seven cyclists performed endurance training only (E). ES, but not E, resulted in increases in isometric half squat performance, lean lower body mass, peak power output during Wingate test, peak aerobic power output (Wmax), power output at 4 mmol L-1 [la-], mean power output during 40-min all-out trial, and earlier occurrence of peak torque during the pedal stroke (P < 0.05). ES achieved superior improvements in Wmax and mean power output during 40-min all-out trial compared with E (P < 0.05). The improvement in 40-min all-out performance was associated with the change toward achieving peak torque earlier in the pedal stroke (r = 0.66, P < 0.01). Neither of the groups displayed alterations in VO2max or cycling economy. In conclusion, heavy strength training leads to improved cycling performance in elite cyclists as evidenced by a superior effect size of ES training vs E training on relative improvements in power output at 4 mmol L-1 [la-], peak power output during 30-s Wingate test, Wmax, and mean power output during 40-min all-out trial.

In particular, strength contributes more in the running events with high running velocity (improves running technique and running economy). Maximal strength, power endurance and strength endurance are the kinds of strength that donate in middle and long distance running performance. The improvement of maximal strength achieved through muscle hypertrophy is the base of the special strength. Special strength enhances through the improvement of explosive strength, depending of the metabolic demands of every event. Training dose response is made according to the percentage of VO2max, the number of repetitions, the exercise duration and the brake-time between each set, which is depending on the intensity and duration of the exercise. Strength endurance seems to be more important in middle distance than in long distance running events. The methods that are used for the improvement of strength endurance are the continuous method and moderate interval training. Additionally, the improvement of strength endurance is depending on the energy demands are chosen every time: exercise intensity up to anaerobic threshold (marathon, aerobic strength endurance), exercise intensity from anaerobic threshold to maximal oxygen uptake (10000m, 5000m, moderate strength endurance), exercise intensity higher than maximal oxygen uptake (800m, 1500m, anaerobic lactic endurance).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the effects of different strength training protocols on short-sprint and vertical jump performance of professional soccer players from the first division of their countries. The following inclusion criteria were employed for the analysis: (a) randomized studies; (b) high validity and reliability instruments; (c) studies published in a high-quality peer-reviewed journal; (d) studies involving professional soccer players from the first division; (e) studies with descriptions of strength training programs; and (f) studies where countermovement jump and 10-m sprint time were measured pre and post training. Overall, the different strength-oriented training schemes produced similar performance improvements, which seem not to depend on the training strategy. Strength training appears to have a lower effect when applied during in-season than when applied in pre-season periods in first division soccer players. In this meta-analysis it is not possible to confirm that strength training in isolation is capable of improving the short-sprint and jump performance of elite soccer players. The congested fixture schedule and, thus, the limited time to perform complementary (non-specific) training sessions, may contribute to these reduced effects.

Thirteen young males (23.2 ± 1.6 years old) participated in this study. The hypertrophic strength-training protocol was composed of 6 sets of 8 squats at 75% of maximal dynamic strength. The plyometric strength-training protocol was composed of 6 sets of 8 jumps performed with the body weight as the workload. Endurance exercise was performed on a cycle ergometer at a power corresponding to the second ventilatory threshold until exhaustion. Before and after each protocol, a maximal voluntary contraction was performed, and the rate of force development and electromyographic parameters were assessed. After the hypertrophic strength-training and plyometric strength-training protocol, significant decreases were observed in the maximal voluntary contraction and rate of force development, whereas no changes were observed in the electromyographic parameters. Oxygen uptake and a heart rate during endurance exercise were not significantly different among the protocols. However, the time-to-exhaustion was significantly higher during endurance exercise alone than when performed after hypertrophic strength-training or plyometric strength-training (p <0.05). These results suggest that endurance performance may be impaired when preceded by strength-training, with no oxygen uptake or heart rate changes during the exercise.

Starting from the physiological factors that affect aerobic capacity, this research attempts to find scientific evidence that strength training improves endurance performance from the perspective of neuromuscular and molecular biological adaptations of strength training, and explores the relevant biological mechanisms. This research adopts literature review to sort out relevant research findings at home and abroad. This paper summarizes the strength training methods and effects of different endurance sports, and analyzes the internal mechanism for improving aerobic capacity. The results show that various types of strength training can improve the performance of endurance events to varying degrees, mainly by improving the percentage utilization of athletes' maximum oxygen uptake and running economy. The mechanism is mainly that strength training improves the adaptability of the neuromuscular system. It indirectly improves aerobic capacity. However, the adaptation of strength and endurance training to the molecular biology of skeletal muscle is still not clear. Conclusions and suggestions: carry out strength training with a targeted arrangement consistent with the special sports mode; combined intervention methods should be used to gradually increase the training load, and finally maintain a strength training program with medium intensity or above; the total intervention time should be more than 8 weeks (2-3 times per week), with a minimum interval of 8 hours between strength and endurance training.

Regular physical activity can improve the metabolic profile and reduce the risks of cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. However, the optimal training regime to treat metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiovascular abnormalities remains undefined. Fortythree participants with metabolic syndrome were randomized to one of the following groups: aerobic interval training (AlT; n = 11), strength training (ST; n = 11), a combination of AlT and ST (COM; n = 10) 3 times/wk for 12 wk, or control (n = 11). Risk factors comprising metabolic syndrome were evaluated before and after the intervention. Waist circumference (in cm) was significantly reduced after AlT [95% confidence interval (CI): -2.5 to -0.041, COM (95% CI: -2.11 to -0.63), and ST (95% CI: -2.68 to -0.84), whereas the control group had an increase in waist circumference (95% CI: 0.37-2.9). The AlT and COM groups had 11% and 10% increases in peak 02 uptake, respectively. There were 45% and 31% increases in maximal strength after ST and COM, respectively. Endothelial function, measured as flow-mediated dilatation (in %), was improved after AlT (95% CI: 0.3-3), COM (95% CI: 0.3-3), and ST (95% CI: 1.5-4.5). There were no changes in body weight, fasting plasma glucose, or HDL levels within or between the groups. In conclusion, all three training regimes have beneficial effects on physiological abnormalities associated with metabolic syndrome.

Methods: Sixteen athletes (10 boys and 6 girls; age 14.9 [1.1] y) performed similar endurance training for 16 weeks (29.1 [7.5] km·wk−1). During weeks 1 to 7, all athletes additionally performed 2 or 3 times weekly whole-body DLST (3 × 6–10 repetitions at 75–85% 1-repetition maximum [1RM]). Thereafter, the DLST frequency was maintained, but athletes were stratified into periodized (experimental, n = 9) and nonperiodized (control, n = 7) DLST groups. The experimental group performed maximal (3 × 3–4 repetitions at 85–90% 1RM) and explosive DLST (throws and unloaded jumps), while in the control group, DLST was maintained. Results: Swimming time at 4 mmol·L−1 of blood lactate improved after 7 weeks in both the experimental (+2.6% [1.8%], P =.033) and the control groups (+3.2% [2.4%], P =.081) and plateaued thereafter. Ten-meter start improved in both the experimental (−3.6% [2.5%], P =.039) and the control groups (−5.1% [2.2%], P =.054) throughout the entire intervention. Both groups improved in maximal weight lifted in half-squat (experimental, +19.6% [14.9%], P =.021; control, +25.7% [18.4%], P =.054) and bench press (experimental, +14.1% [4.8%], P =.018; control, +19.3% [11.1%], P =.051). Countermovement-jump height increased only in the experimental group throughout the intervention (+19.4% [7.0%], P =.024). The associations for the pooled changes in half-squat performance and 4 mmol·L−1 of blood lactate were statistically significant (r =.560, P =.024). Conclusions: The findings do not support the superior effects of DLST periodization in adolescent swimmers. However, the association between improvements in lower-body strength and swimming performance still indicates the importance of muscle strength in this age group.

Before and after the experimental period the subjects performed the following tests: a) maximum dynamic strength test, b) maximal incremental treadmill test, and c) time to exhaustion at velocity corresponding to maximal oxygen uptake. The fractions of the aerobic and anaerobic contribution in time to exhaustion test were also calculated. Both strength trained groups showed a similar increase in maximum dynamic strength (~18 %). The aerobic contribution was enhanced for strength training group without whole-body vibration (~25 %) after experimental period. No statistical differences were observed in any other variable. These results suggest that 6 weeks of strength training performed with or without whole-body vibration improve similarly the maximum dynamic strength in long-distance runners. In addition, both training modes studied had no deleterious effects on the traditional parameters of endurance performance, traditional strength training program results in increased aerobic contribution during high-intensity aerobic exercise.

Our goal was to evaluate the effects of two different exercise training protocols on adult rat patellar tendon. Ninety-six male Wistar rats were divided into a sedentary group (control), a resistance-trained group and an endurance-trained group. The examinations were performed after 15, 30 and 45 days of training and after 2 weeks of rest since training was stopped. The content of collagen fibers and the cell nuclei number were quantified on tendon cross sections. In order to assess the training effectiveness, we evaluated the heart/body weight ratio, which was higher in 45 day-trained rats than their controls ( P<0.01), showing the presence of cardiac hypertrophy. An increase in the content of collagen fibers was observed in the 45 day-trained groups and after 2 weeks of rest in the endurance group. Moreover, both trained groups showed a decrease in cell nuclei number after 30 and 45 days of training and 2 weeks of rest ( P<0.05). Endurance and resistance training induces a tendon tissue remodeling that depends on the length and intensity of workload rather than the training type. Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether these structural modifications are associated with an increase in the mechanical strength of tendon.

MetS patients (aged 56 ± 7 years; body mass index 33 ± 5 kg·m−2 and 3.9 ± 0.8 MetS factors) were randomized to undergo 1 of the following isocaloric, 16-week long exercise programs: (i) cycling 4 bouts of 4-min at 90% of maximal heart rate (HRmax) followed by 3 sets of 12 repetitions of 3 lower limb free-weight exercises (high-intensity interval training (HIIT)+RT group; n = 33), (ii) cycling 5 bouts of 4 min at 90% of HRmax (HIIT+HIIT group; n = 33), or (iii) no exercise control group (n = 21). We measured the evolution of all 5 MetS components (z score), cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen uptake), leg strength and power (leg press 1-repetition maximum (1RM) and countermovement jump (CMJ)), fasting blood glucose (FG), fasting insulin, and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment 2). Both training groups improved maximal oxygen uptake similarly (170 ± 310 and 190 ± 210 mL O2·min−1; P < 0.001) and z score (−0.12 ± 0.29 and −0.12 ± 0.31 for HIIT+RT and HIIT+HIIT, respectively; P < 0.02). However, only HIIT+RT improved CMJ (P = 0.002) and leg press 1RM above the HIIT+HIIT group (21% vs 6%; P < 0.001). Furthermore, FG only decreased in the HIIT+RT group (5%; P = 0.026, time × group). Our findings suggest that substitution of part of HIIT by leg RT improves glucose control in MetS individuals. Novelty Most studies addressing the efficacy of endurance versus resistance training are not matched by energy expenditure. We found that substituting 20% of AT with RT reduces hyperglycemia in MetS individuals. Training recommendations to regain glycemic control in MetS individuals should include resistance training.

"Suspended Push-up Training Augments Size of not only Upper Limb but also Abdominal Muscles.","Kohiruimaki, Ren; Maeo, Sumiaki; Kanehisa, Hiroaki","International Journal of Sports Medicine",="01724622",,="20191115","40","12","789","7","139437997",,,"Article","ARM physiology; ELBOW physiology; PHYSIOLOGY of abdominal muscles; ABDOMINAL muscles; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; EXERCISE; EXERCISE physiology; RANGE of motion of joints; MUSCLE contraction; PHYSICAL fitness",,"We investigated the effects of sling-based, suspended push-up training on muscle size and function of upper limb and abdominal muscles. Eight men conducted suspended push-ups to failure 3 sets/session, 3 sessions/week, for 8 weeks. The maximum number of push-ups during training gradually and significantly increased from the first to last training session (+92%), suggesting improved muscle endurance. After the training, muscle thickness of the elbow extensors (+16%) and flexors (+3%), as well as abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis: RA,+27%; external oblique: EO,+14%) significantly increased. No changes occurred in maximum isometric strength of elbow extension or flexion, nor in 1-repetition maximum bench press. In a follow-up experiment, electromyograms (EMGs) of RA, EO and internal oblique (IO) during suspended push-ups to failure were measured and normalized to those during maximum voluntary contraction of each muscle (% EMGmvc) in six men. EMG significantly increased when reaching failure in all muscles (RA: 46–88%, EO: 32–50%, IO: 19–52%, start-end), and was particularly high in RA. These results suggest that suspended push-up training can augment size of not only upper limb but also abdominal muscles, likely attributable to high muscle activities during exercise; however, this does not necessarily improve maximum strength after training thus warrants careful interpretation/application.

As carbohydrate metabolism is relevant for myocardial resistance to ischemia, we also test whether hyperglycemia blunts the protective effect of training. Eight-week old rats were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 6-8): sedentary or trained (3-week swim program, up to 2 h/day), and normal or high-carbohydrate diet (50 g/l sucrose in drinking water). Excised hearts were perfused isovolumically (flow - 15 ml/min) with Krebs-Henseleit (2 mM free Ca++, 11 mM glucose, pH 7.38 +/- 0.02, PO2 = 670 +/- 6 mmHg, PCO2 = 43 +/- 1 mmHg, mean +/- SE), exposed to 60 min low-flow (1.5 ml/min) ischemia, and then reperfused for 30 min (15 ml/min). In normally fed rats training increased the stroke volume index (97.5 +/- 13.0 vs. 72.6 +/- 6.2 mul, P = 0.05), depressed diastolic contracture (+2.3 +/- 2.0 vs. +24.2 +/- 6.7 mmHg, P = 0.02), improved the recovery of developed pressure.heart rate (33.8 +/- 2.3 vs. 24.1 +/- 3.3 mmHg/min/1000, P = 0.05), and decreased arrhythmias (P = 0.05). In high-carbohydrate-fed rats training induced myocardial hypertrophy (1.95 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.67 +/- 0.03 g, P = 0.02) and decreased arrhythmias but did not affect stroke volume, developed pressure.heart rate, and diastolic contracture. Thus endurance training improves myocardial resistance to ischemia but a high-carbohydrate diet partially blunts this protection. The occurrence of an inducible alteration able to modulate myocardial tolerance to ischemia may give clues to extend our knowledge of ischemic preconditioning.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-653066&site=ehost-live"

Regulation of glucose homeostasis involves cross-talk between the central nervous system, peripheral tissues, and gut microbiota, and is affected by genetics. Systemic cross-talk between brain, gut, and peripheral tissues in glucose homeostasis: effects of exercise training (CROSSYS) aims to gain new systems-level understanding of the central metabolism in human body, and how exercise training affects this cross-talk. Methods: CROSSYS is an exercise training intervention, in which participants are monozygotic twins from pairs discordant for body mass index (BMI) and within a pair at least the other is overweight. Twins are recruited from three population-based longitudinal Finnish twin studies, including twins born in 1983–1987, 1975–1979, and 1945–1958. The participants undergo 6-month-long exercise intervention period, exercising four times a week (including endurance, strength, and high-intensity training). Before and after the exercise intervention, comprehensive measurements are performed in Turku PET Centre, Turku, Finland. The measurements include: two positron emission tomography studies (insulin-stimulated whole-body and tissue-specific glucose uptake and neuroinflammation), magnetic resonance imaging (brain morphology and function, quantification of body fat masses and organ volumes), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (quantification of fat within heart, pancreas, liver and tibialis anterior muscle), echocardiography, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue biopsies, a neuropsychological test battery as well as biosamples from blood, urine and stool. The participants also perform a maximal exercise capacity test and tests of muscular strength. Discussion: This study addresses the major public health problems related to modern lifestyle, obesity, and physical inactivity. An eminent strength of this project is the possibility to study monozygotic twin pairs that share the genome at the sequence level but are discordant for BMI that is a risk factor for metabolic impairments such as insulin resistance. Thus, this exercise training intervention elucidates the effects of obesity on metabolism and whether regular exercise training is able to reverse obesity-related impairments in metabolism in the absence of the confounding effects of genetic factors.

Seventy-two CrossFit athletes (39 females, 33 males) (mean ±SD; 26.5 ± 3.6 y, 167.1 ± 9.5 cm, 74.5 ± 12.7 kg, 12.8 ± 6.5 y general training, 5.4 ± 1.7 y CrossFit training) who competed at the ""Regionals"" level or higher in the 2018 CrossFit Games season completed a self-reported 5-page online survey. Almost all athletes (98.6%) tapered before important competitions. Taper length was 5.4 ± 2.7 days, with the step and linear tapering styles being most commonly utilised. Strength training volume peaked 5.1 ± 4.6 weeks before competition, whereas conditioning training volume peaked 4.0 ± 4.4 weeks before competition. Strength training intensity peaked 3.1 ± 2.4 weeks before competition, whereas conditioning training intensity peaked 2.8 ± 2.2 weeks before competition. Almost all athletes (90.0%) reduced training duration during tapering, but changes to frequency and intensity were mixed. Training volume decreased by 41.2 ± 15.5% during the taper, all training ceased 2.0 ± 1.1 days before competition. Tapering was performed to achieve peak performance, recover (physically and psychologically), and reduce feelings of fatigue. Poor results from tapering were experienced when athletes tapered for too long or insufficiently. This observational data may be valuable for coaches and athletes engaged in CrossFit as well as other sports with concurrent training and competition demands.

We hypothesized that capillarization would increase proportionally, and concurrently, with muscle fiber hypertrophy in response to resistance training in young men. Methods In this double-blind, randomized control trial, 36 men (22 ± 1 yr) were randomized to placebo or protein supplementation, and participated in 12 wk of resistance training. Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected before and after 2, 4, 8, and 12 wk of training. Immunohistochemistry assessed fiber type-specific size and capillarization. Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assessed proteins involved in the molecular regulation of angiogenesis. Results Resistance training effectively increased Type I (15% ± 4%; P < 0.01) and Type II fiber cross-sectional area (28% ± 5%; P < 0.0001), an effect that tended to be further enhanced with protein supplementation in Type II fibers (P = 0.078). Capillary-to-fiber ratio significantly increased in Type I (P = 0.001) and II (P = 0.015) fibers after 12 wk of resistance exercise training and was evident after only 2 wk. Capillary-to-fiber perimeter exchange index increased in the Type I fibers only (P = 0.054) after 12 wk of training. Training resulted in a reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA. A (P = 0.008), while vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (P = 0.016), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (P = 0.016), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (P = 0.01) increased in both groups. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α protein content was higher in the protein group (main group effect, P = 0.02), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase content demonstrated a divergent relationship (time-group interaction, P = 0.049). Conclusions This study presents novel evidence that microvascular adaptations and the molecular pathways involved are elevated after 2 wk of a 12-wk resistance training program. Increases in muscle fiber cross-sectional area are effectively matched by the changes in the microvasculature, providing further support for resistance training programs to optimize metabolic health.

However, the test-retest reliability of RPE for resistance exercise has not been determined. Additionally, prior research regarding the relationship between 1RM and RPE is conflicting. * OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to (1) determine test-retest reliability of RPE related to resistance exercise and (2) assess agreement between percentages of 1RM and RPE during quadriceps resistance exercise. * METHODS: A sample of participants with and without knee pathology completed a series of knee extension exercises and rated the perceived difficulty of each exercise on a 0-to-10 RPE scale, then repeated the procedure 1 to 2 weeks later for test-retest reliability. To determine agreement between RPE and 1RM, participants completed knee extension exercises at various percentages of their 1RM (10% to 130% of predicted 1RM) and rated the perceived difficulty of each exercise on a 0-to-10 RPE scale. Percent agreement was calculated between the 1RM and RPE at each resistance interval. * RESULTS: The intraclass correlation coefficient indicated excellent test-retest reliability of RPE for quadriceps resistance exercises (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.895; 95% confidence interval: 0.866, 0.918). Overall percent agreement between RPE and 1RM was 60%, but agreement was poor within the ranges that would typically be used for training (50% 1RM for muscle endurance, 70% 1RM and greater for strength). * CONCLUSION: Test-retest reliability of perceived exertion during quadriceps resistance exercise was excellent. However, agreement between the RPE and 1RM was poor, especially in common training zones for knee extensor strengthening.

In both studies, subjects performed a graded exercise test in tethered swimming (GET) to determine anaerobic threshold (AnT), stroke rate at AnT (SRAnT), peak force at GET (PFGET) and peak blood lactate ([ La-]GET). Participants also swam 100-, 200- and 400-m lengths to evaluate performance. In Study 2, swimmers were divided into control (i. e., only free-swimming; GC [n = 11]) and tethered swimming group (i. e., 50 % of the main session; GTS [n = 10]). The results of Study 1 demonstrate that AnT, PFGET, [La-]GET and 200-m performance were improved with free-swimming training. The SRAnT decreased with training. In Study 2, free-swimming performance and most of the graded exercise test parameters were not altered in either group. However, [La-]GET improved only for GTS. These results demonstrate that aerobic parameters obtained in tethered swimming can be used to evaluate free-swimming training responses, and the addition of tethered efforts during training routine improves the lactate production capacity of swimmers.

The CCT group undertook strength training on alternating days combined with endurance training on consecutive days for 6 days. One week later, the CCT group conducted 3 consecutive days of endurance training only to determine whether fatigue would be induced with endurance training alone (CCT-Con). Endurance training was undertaken to induce endurance-training stimulus and to measure the cost of running (CR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and time to exhaustion (TTE). The ST group undertook 3 strength-training sessions on alternating days. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), rating of muscle soreness (RMS), and rating of muscle fatigue (RMF) were collected prior to each strength and endurance session.Results:For the CCT group, small differences were primarily found in CRand RPE (ES = 0.17–0.41). However, moderate-to-large reductions were found for TTE and MVC (ES = 0.65–2.00), whereas large increases in RMS and RMF (ES = 1.23–2.49) were found prior to each strength- and endurance-training session. Small differences were found in MVC for the ST group (ES = 0.11) and during CCT-Con for the CCT group (ES = 0.15–0.31).Conclusion:Combining strength training on alternating days with endurance training on consecutive days impairs MVC and running performance at maximal effort and increases RMS and RMF over 6 days.

Ccombining resistance and in-water training is a common practice in water polo. The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of different external loads during resistance training on the repeated sprint ability in water polo players. Methods. A total of 9 national level water polo players (age: 21.5 ± 2.0 years) executed, on different occasions, a repeated sprint swimming test (8 x 25 m with a 30-s rest) following a low load (50% of 1-repetition maximum) or a high load (80% of 1-repetition maximum) resistance training that consisted of leg press and bench press exercises. During the control condition, the players only performed the repeated ability test. Indices of repeated sprint ability included the best 25-m time (best), the mean time (mean), and the heart rate after the 4th and the 8th 25-m effort. In addition, the performance decrement was calculated. Results. Control and low load intensity conditions resulted in significantly faster best times than high load intensity (p < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). Mean times were significantly faster during the control compared with the high load intensity condition (p < 0.05). Performance decrement and heart rate after the 4th and the 8th 25-m effort showed no differences between all 3 conditions (p > 0.05). Conclusions. These results suggest that when scheduling intrasession resistance and in-water training in water polo, low load programs should be preferred when the primary goal is the enhancement of repeated swimming performance.

Heart rate, blood lactate concentration, rate of perceived exertion, and VO2 at the first and the fifth km were considered for statistical purposes. There were no significant effects of both strength bouts on any of the variables associated with endurance performance (p > 0.05). It seems that both maximum and strength endurance bouts do not acutely impair aerobic performance.

Thirteen varsity male basketball players, aged 18 to 25 yrs (age, 21.00 ± 1.63 yrs; height, 183.46 ± 7.99 cm; body mass, 78.16 ± 11.27 kg; and relative 1RM back squat, 1.74 ± 021 kg·BM-1), performed three counterbalanced sessions: CT1 consisted of 6 reps of BS followed by 12 reps of WJ; CT2 consisted of 6 reps of BS followed by 12 reps of BA; and CT3 consisted of 3 exercises (6 reps of BS followed by 6 reps of WJ and 6 reps of BA). The peak power (PPO), peak force (PF), peak velocity (PV), time to peak force (TPF), peak rate of force development (PRFD), RFD150, RFD250, and vertical jump displacement (VJD) were assessed before the experiment to set as baseline and after each intervention. There were no significant differences (P>0.05) in PF, TPF, PPO, RFD150, and VJD between three methods. However, CT2 showed a significantly greater PRFD (P<0.05) over CT1 and CT3. In addition, both CT2 and CT3 presented significantly better on PV (P<0.05) than CT1. Only CT2 reported a significant difference (P<0.05) in RFD250 across groups. In conclusion, the outcomes highlight that CT2 method is the most effective protocol to increase the rate of force development. Nevertheless, this current study confirmed that the contrast training could be incorporated on a regular training regimen in order to enhance jumping performance, force, and power production in basketball players.

Methods: Day-to-day TrVs were recorded and averaged for a 5-year period for male biathletes (n = 6), female biathletes (n = 8), and XC (n = 14) with VO2max values of 77.7 (3.8), 64.6 (1.9), and 79.4 (3.5) mL·min−1·kg−1, respectively. Results: The volumes of low- and moderate-intensity endurance training and all types of nonspecific endurance and strength training gradually decreased toward the competition period. However, the volumes and proportions of high-intensity endurance training and specific exercises (roller skiing, skiing, and shooting during high-intensity endurance training) increased by the time of the competition period. The total volume of training, volumes of low- and moderate-intensity endurance training, moderate- and high-load strength training (70%–95% 1RM), and power/speed loads did not increase gradually but reached their maximum immediately after a short stage of initial training. All teams employed the ""pyramid"" model of intensity distribution. Compared with the biathletes, XC demonstrated a larger (P <.01) annual volume of endurance training (~190 h), low-intensity endurance training (~183 h), and strength training (~818 sets). They also engaged in more upper-body and core-strength exercises (~769 sets), and they reached their maximum aerobic TrVs in June, while the biathletes reached theirs in July. Conclusions: In recent decades, the traditional model of periodization has been altered. The Russian XC and biathletes had significant differences in TrVs.

"The Athlete's Heart: A Contemporary Appraisal of the 'Morganroth Hypothesis'.","Naylor, Louise H.; George, Keith; O'Driscoll, Gerry; Green, Daniel J.","Sports Medicine",="01121642",,="20080101","38","1","69","22","28558726",,,"Article","ATHLETES; PHYSICAL fitness; MAGNETIC resonance imaging; PHYSICAL education; EXERCISE physiology; EXERCISE tests; CLINICAL exercise physiology; SPORTS facilities; CARDIAC magnetic resonance imaging",,"As early as 1975, Morganroth and colleagues hypothesized that the cardiac morphological adaptation observed in athletes corresponded with the nature of the haemodynamic stimulus imposed on the ventricles during repeated exercise bouts. Endurance training purportedly leads to an eccentric form of cardiac hypertrophy, principally characterized by increased left ventricular (LV) cavity dimension, and thus LV mass (LVM), as a consequence of prolonged repetitive volume overload. In contrast, strength training is supposedly associated with a concentric form of hypertrophy where increased ventricular wall thickness, with no change in cavity size, underpins the elevated LVM as a consequence of the pressure overload produced during strenuous resistive exercise. The 'Morganroth hypothesis' has been broadly adopted in the scientific and medical literature, partly as a consequence of a large body of cross-sectional evidence suggesting that endurance athletes have greater cavity dimensions than control subjects or resistance athletes. However, in conflict with the 'Morganroth hypothesis', several studies suggest that LV wall thickness is increased more in endurance-, than strengthtrained athletes and others have reported no morphological changes in resistancetrained athletes. Such controversial data may reflect variability in the training stimuli, with little obvious attempt to quantify these issues in previous research. Further reflection on the 'Morganroth hypothesis' may also be pertinent as more sensitive technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging, are now being employed for the assessment of cardiac morphology. Finally, the process of scaling (or normalizing) cardiac size for between-subject differences in body size and composition has further complicated the description and understanding of cardiac morphology in athletes. Specifically, it is possible that the increased LVM observed in some athletes may merely reflect a 'larger than normal' body size. These considerations emphasise the limitations of the predominance of crosssectional comparisons in the available literature, which assume that differences between groups are due to a training effect per se rather than other betweensubject differences. The small number of longitudinal training studies undertaken in athletes suggest that individuals with athlete's heart can exhibit further cardiac adaptation in response to training resumption. Longitudinal training studies undertaken in previously sedentary subjects generally indicate that exercise results in enlargement of LV cavity size, increases in wall thickness or LVM following training. However, there are currently limited longitudinal data available to comment on the effects of different modalities of exercise training on LV cavity dimension and wall thickness. In summary, significant caveats related to cross-sectional literature, the relative insensitivity of echocardiographic measurements and the paucity of evidence from longitudinal exercise training studies, warrant ongoing research to verify the 'Morganroth hypothesis'.

Most athletes with abnormal electrocardiograms are asymptomatic and numerous investigators have failed to detect heart disease in association with such electrocardiograms. In contrast to cardiac dysfunction observed in clinical cases, enhanced or normal ventricular systolic and diastolic function have been reported in athletes. In endurance athletes, this is associated with very high values for maximal aerobic power (VO2max). Since the mid 1970s echocardiography has been used to compare cardiac dimensions in male endurance- and resistance-trained athletes. However, there is a paucity of data on cardiac dimensions in female athletes. Finally, physical conditioning studies have also examined echocardiographic dimensions before and after endurance and resistance training. Significant enlargement of internal dimensions, wall thickness or left ventricular mass have been reported. Several conflicting explanations for enlarged cardiac dimensions appear in the literature. Chronic volume and pressure haemodynamic overloading during physical conditioning has been proposed to explain eccentric and concentric cardiac enlargement. However, twin studies suggest that hereditary factors may be important determinants of cardiac dimensions and/or the degree of cardiac adaptability to physical conditioning. Another body of research has suggested the possibility that endocrine effects related to normal growth and/or physical conditioning may stimulate cardiac enlargement. Thyroid hormone, catecholamines, growth hormone and testosterone can alter cardiac dimensions and their blood levels are elevated with exercise. However, their influence on myocardial structure in athletes has not yet been clarified. Future investigations should reassess the role of haemodynamic stress and clarify the quantitative role of heredity and endocrine factors in determining cardiac dimensions. Research should first describe the cardiac profile of a wide range of female athletes and then determine the cause of any potential gender-based differences in cardiac size and adaptation to exercise.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH274890&site=ehost-live"

The aim of this study was to characterize the oxidative stress and antioxidant defense adaptations in untrained boys after a regimen of combined training alone or together with garlic administration. In the present quisi-experimental study, 46 untrained volunteer boys were randomly assigned into 4 groups: garlic + train (n = 13), placebo + train (n = 13), garlic (n = 10), and control (n = 10). The combined training protocol comprised of endurance training (60–80% HR max , running) and resistance training (40–85% 1RM, weight training) for 8 weeks. Capsules containing 250 mg garlic were administered on a daily basis in the garlic and train + garlic groups for 8 weeks. The two-way ANOVA test was employed to determine within-group and between-group differences. The Least Significant Difference (LSD) post hoc test was performed to locate the differences. Data were analyzed by SPSS v.20 with a significance level of P < 0.05. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level, as a marker of oxidative stress, decreased significantly in the train + placebo (P = 0.01), train + garlic (P < 0.001), and garlic (P < 0.001) groups, whilst no change occured in the control (P = 0.33) group. The index of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) significantly increased in the train + placebo (P = 0.02), train + garlic (P = 0.01), and garlic (P = 0.005) groups with no change in the control group (P = 0.90). The two indices TAC (P = 0.001) and serum MDA (P = 0.001) had significant differences between four groups. The LSD post hoc test showed significant differences between garlic and control and between train + garlic and control groups for both MDA and TAC. the present research suggests that resistance and endurance training synergistically improve the defense against oxidative stress, and that this effect is even enhanced by garlic antioxidant supplement.

Nineteen women and 12 men performed a 2000m simulated race on a rowing machine before and after 8 weeks of physical training. The simulated 2000m race was separated into 4 quadrants of 500m and kinematic measurements were taken during the last 100m of each quadrant while cardiorespiratory variables were monitored every minute. Force and power production decreased from the first 500m to the third 500m, followed by an increase during the final 500m (p<0.05) of the simulated 2000m race. Significant changes occurred in hip, knee and elbow angle at various phases of the rowing stroke throughout the race as a result of accumulated fatigue. Stroke length decreased from the first two 500m quadrants to the third, as well as between the second and last 500m quadrants (p<0.05). Stroke rate decreased over the first 1500m but was highest in the last 500m of the race (p<0.05). Heart rate increased throughout the race while V̇O2 increased (p<0.05) over the first 1500m only (p<0.05). After training, power production and the percent of stroke that peak force and power occurred increased. These alterations corresponded to changes in hip and elbow angles as well as strength and V̇O2 max that resulted in a faster 2000m rowing race time (p<0.05). Significant differences in mechanical and physiological variables were observed between men and women. It was concluded that changes in mechanical and physiological variables occur as a result of fatigue during a simulated 2000m rowing race that vary by gender and these can be positively influenced by training.

PURPOSE: Compare the effects of periodized lower body strength training versus high intensity circuit strength training on running performance and related variables in experienced runners. METHODS: Participants (N=19) were randomized to 8 weeks of periodized lower body strength training (PLB), n=9, or high intensity circuit training (CT), n=10. All participants strength trained 2 d⋅wk-1 and followed their typical running schedule. PLB sessions included 2 sets of the back squat, standing calf raise, leg press, and dumbbell lunge, with intensity linearly periodized. PLB initially completed sets at 10-repetition maximum (10-RM) and progressed each 2 weeks to 8-RM, 6-RM, and 4-RM. CT sessions included a high intensity, whole body resistance circuit followed by 2-4 heavy (>10-RM) sets of a compound lift, simulating CrossFit©-style programming. 3-km time trial (TT), VO2 max, relative leg press 1-RM, running economy (RE) at 2 standard submaximal velocities (SV1, SV2) between 11 and 14 km⋅hr-1, RPE at SV1/SV2, and peak/mean power during the Wingate Anaerobic Test were assessed pre and post-intervention. RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA showed a significant main effect of time on RE at 11 km⋅hr-1 (F = 8.31, p = .02, ηp² = 0.51) and RPE at SV1 (F = 11.2, p = .004, ηp² =40), and a significant group*time interaction on 1-RM (F = 7.66, p = .015, ηp² =.35) and RPE at SV2 (F = 5.30, p = .037, ηp² =.28). Similar (p ≤ .02) increases occurred in RE at 11 km⋅hr-1 (36.4 ± 3.1 to 35.4 ± 2.4 ml⋅kg-1⋅mm-1) and RPE at SV 1 (12.5 ± 1.3 to 11.4 ± 1.6). Relative 1-RM (2.54 ± 0.41 to 3.40 ± 0.72) and RPE at SV2 (14.1 ± 1.3 to 12.9 ± 1.8) improved in both groups (p ≤ .03). However, PLB showed larger improvements in 1-RM (0.43 ± 0.18 vs. 0.2 ± 1.9, t = 2.75, p = .015) and RPE at SV2 (-1.75 ± 0.9 vs. -0.63 ± 1.1, t = 2.30, p = .037). TT, VO2 max, RE at 12-14 km⋅hr-1, and power were unchanged (p ≥ . 27). CONCLUSIONS: Both modalities enhanced lower body strength, RE at 11 km⋅hr-1 and submaximal RPE at submaximal, but neither improved TT performance, VO2 max, power, or RE at faster velocities. PLB resulted in greater improvements in lower body strength and RPE at higher submaximal running velocity.

Fifteen healthy, active young men (mean age ± SD of 23 ± 1.604 years, height 173 ± 3.751 m, weight 69 ± 8.742 kg) were participated in research voluntarily. The same subjects were taking part in three types of exercise in three different time with 7-day interval among them. Blood samples taken before, immediately and 20 min after the exercise. t Test and analysis of variance were used to analyse the data (p<0.01). Results show GH secretion rate increased significantly immediately and 20 min after exercise (E) and immediately after exercise (C) compared to pretest. There were no significantly increase in the rate of GH secretion 20 min after exercise (C), immediately and 20 min after exercise (R). There was no significant differences between the rate of GH secretion (immediately and 20 min after exercise) after E and C exercise and there was no significant difference between GH secretion immediately after exercise and 20 min after exercise (E, R, C). There were significant differences between GH secretion immediately and 20 min after exercise (E with R) and (C with R). Exercise directly leads to GH production changing pattern, which in turn results in creation of new tissues. It is believed that GH concentrations can change with exercise. The results of this research showed that GH concentrations was increased after endurance exercise (20 min and immediately after exercise compared to pretest), and combined exercise. It is generally concluded that various types of physical activity has a different effects on the GH responses.

Five electronic databases were searched using terms related to HIIT, RT, and concurrent training. Effect size (ES), calculated as standardised differences in the means, were used to examine the effect of concurrent HIIT and RT compared to RT alone on muscle strength and hypertrophy. Sub-analyses were performed to assess region-specific strength and hypertrophy, HIIT modality (cycling versus running), and intermodal rest responses. Compared to RT alone, concurrent HIIT and RT led to similar changes in muscle hypertrophy and upper body strength. Concurrent HIIT and RT resulted in a lower increase in lower body strength compared to RT alone (ES = -0.248, p = 0.049). Sub analyses showed a trend for lower body strength to be negatively affected by cycling HIIT (ES = -0.377, p = 0.074) and not running (ES = -0.176, p = 0.261). Data suggests concurrent HIIT and RT does not negatively impact hypertrophy or upper body strength, and that any possible negative effect on lower body strength may be ameliorated by incorporating running based HIIT and longer inter-modal rest periods.

Following a 6-wk control period, 13 healthy inactive males were assigned to a low dose (LDG: n = 7) or high dose (HDG: n = 6) supervised 6-wk intervention: ×2/wk of SIT (LDG = 2 sets of 5 × 6 s ON: 18 s OFF bouts; HDG = 4–6 sets); ×1/wk resistance training (3 exercises at 3 × 10 reps). Outcome measures were tested pre and post control (baseline (BL) 1 and 2), 72 h post (0POST), and 3-wk post (3POST) intervention. At 0POST, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) increased in the LDG (+16%) and HDG (+11%) vs. BL 2, with no differences between groups (p = 0.381). At 3POST, VO2peak was different between LDG (−11%) and HDG (+3%) vs. 0POST. Positive responses for the intervention's perceived enjoyment (PE) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were found for both groups. Blood pressure, blood lipids, or body composition were not different between groups at any time point. Conclusion: LDG and HDG significantly improved VO2peak at 0POST. However, findings at 3POST suggest compromised VO2peak at 0POST in the HDG due to the delayed time course of adaptations. These findings should be considered when implementing high-dose SIT protocols for non-athletic populations.

Methods: Twenty-five overweight and obese subjects were divided into two groups and participated in either resistance or aerobic training for a period of 3 months (3 sessions per week). Prior to and following the training, they performed foot tapping and step execution tests under various conditions. Results: Subsequent to both aerobic and resistance training, there was a significant decrease in the time from foot-off to foot-contact during spontaneous step initiation (9%, p = 0.019 vs. 7.6%, p = 0.036), visually triggered step initiation (8%, p = 0.027 vs. 7%, p = 0.039), and step initiation with eyes closed (7.6%, p = 0.030 vs. 5.9%, p = 0.044). However, mean CoP trajectory in X-axis during the back step (21.4%, p = 0.012), spontaneous step initiation (18.6%, p = 0.019), visually triggered step initiation (18.4%, p = 0.020), and step initiation with eyes closed (15.0%, p = 0.038) decreased significantly following the resistance training only. On the other hand, the number and frequency of taps increased significantly following the aerobic training (7.5%, p = 0.025 and 4.6%, p = 0.042), concurrently with a significant decrease in flight time (8.3%, p = 0.037). Conclusions: Both aerobic and resistance training, for a period of 3 months, increase the speed of step initiation in overweight and obese individuals. However, medio-lateral postural stability during step execution improves after the resistance training but fails to improve following the aerobic training. In contrast, foot tapping frequency increases after the aerobic training but not after the resistance training.

The sample consisted of 45 young boys, aged from 11 to 13 years old (11.9±0.7yrs), who were divided into 3 groups: the combined training group (CG), the basketball training group (BG) and a control group (COG). The CG performed a basketball training combined with a strengthening program, while the BG followed only a basketball training program and the COG did not perform regular training. The BG participated in a 3-month basketball training program while the intervention for the CG involved a 3-month program combining basketball training as well as abdominal and dorsal exercises, submersions, push-ups, projections and rises of the feet, jogging backwards and isometric squat-positions. The children's performance in push-ups, submersions, abdominals, mobility, speed, medical ball throwing, endurance, the lower limbs extensor muscles' force and in jumping capacity was evaluated just before and right after the end of the application of the 3-month program. For the statistical elaboration of the data a two way ANOVA analysis of variation was used (group × measure 3×2) with repetitive measuring of the factor ""measurement"" as well as tukey's analysis whenever necessary. From the elaboration of the results, it was found that there were statistically significant interactions among the factors ""measurement"" and ""groups"" in all the tests apart from the mobility and retrogression test. In conclusion, comparing the efficiency of the two programmes, the CG's training program was more efficient, in relation to the other two groups, regarding the improvement in strength of the upper part of the body in young basketball players.

Fourteen blind children, 15.93+1.33 years old, participated in this study. Nine individuals were assigned to the experimental group and underwent an 8-week intervention program with Greek traditional dancing, and Pilates movements at a frequency of 2 training sessions per week, for 45 minutes each session, while five individuals were assigned to the control group and participated in the school physical education lessons at a frequency of 2 lessons per week, for 45 minutes each lesson for 8 weeks, the analytic content of which is defined from the Ministry of Education. For balance assessment, the tasks for static and dynamic balance of the MABC-2 (Henderson et al., 2007) and the BOT-2 (Bruininks, & Bruininks, 2005) were used. For data analysis the non-parametric tests Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon of the SPSS ver. 18.0 for windows were used. After the intervention program with Greek traditional dances and Pilates, were observed significant improvements on the three tasks of static balance (p<0.05-0.01), as well as on the four tasks of dynamic balance (p<0.05-0.01) in the experimental group. Likewise no significant difference was observed in the control group. Consequently, the combination of Greek dances and Pilates may be used as an alternative physical activity form, in order to produce benefits in both static and dynamic balance for individuals who are blind.

Method: A systematic search was undertaken of six databases until May 2018. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared the effect of A-HIIT in a non-athletic population with a control group that received no exercise training. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and meta-analyses were undertaken using a random effects model to produce standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's risk of bias tool. All studies were graded using Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and Consensus for Exercise Reporting Template (CERT) scales to determine quality of reporting. Results: Eight studies reported over 13 papers met study criteria (n = 377). Compared with a control group, those who completed a program of A-HIIT demonstrated greater aerobic performance (SMD 0.69 (95% CI 0.39–0.98); I2 = 0%; n = 191) and lower limb muscle strength (SMD 0.30 (95% CI 0.04–0.56); I2 = 0%; n = 237). No differences were seen in measures of body composition or the number of adverse events. All studies were at risk of performance bias. The (mean ± SD) PEDro and CERT scores were 4.9 ± 1.5 and 15.1 ± 2.1, respectively. Conclusion: In a non-athletic population, A-HIIT was safe and may have improved aerobic performance and lower limb strength. The exercise interventions were well described and monitoring and reporting of exercise intensity in water was feasible.

In this study, the effect of combined training on serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 18 (IL18), anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL10) and metabolic syndrome-related factors in elderly women with fatty liver was investigated. Methods: twenty-four elderly women with NAFLD were selected purposively and were randomly divided into training (n = 12) and control (n = 12) groups. Combined training was performed for ten weeks. Using ZellBio kit, IL18 and IL10 levels were measured by ELISA and fatty liver levels by ultrasound procedure. Blood and anthropometric factors were measured as well. Statistical analysis was performed using paired samples t-test and Wilcoxon, covariance and Spearman correlation procedures. Results: Decreased and increased serum concentrations of interleukin 18 (P = 0.00) and interleukin 10 (P = 0.00) were observed in the training group compared to the control group, respectively. Also, weight, waist circumference (P = 0.00) and metabolic markers including triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.00), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (P = 0.01), liver fat (P = 0.00), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P = 0.04) and glucose (P = 0.00) levels were significantly reduced. Moreover, there was no significant difference between insulin (P = 0.11) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P = 0.07) levels. Conclusion: Combined training can improve the levels of inflammatory cytokines and reduce metabolic risk factors associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver and play an effective role in the health of the elderly by augmenting anti-inflammatory effects.

This study compared the effects of 3 different 8-wk training programs [endurance training (ET), strength training (ST) and concurrent training (CT)] on blood lipid profile and body composition in untrained young men. Methods: A total of 27 subjects were randomly allocated to an ET, ST or CT group which performed either progressive treadmill (ET), free weight (ST) or both the endurance and strength training requirements for 8 weeks. Results: High-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein profiles significantly improved in the ET and CT groups (P < .01) but not in the ST group. Triglyceride and total cholesterol profiles significantly improved in all 3 training groups. Total fat mass significantly decreased in the ET and CT groups (P < .001) but not in the ST group, whereas fat free mass significantly increased in the ST and CT groups (P < .01) but not in the ET group. Conclusions: These results indicate that CT can be used to simultaneously improve both the serum lipid profile and body composition of previously untrained, apparently health young men.

Patients and methods Thirty obese young men students (age = 23.2 ± 1.4 year, BMI = 31.8 ± 1.6 kg/m 2 ) were randomly divided into three groups: concurrent resistance-endurance (CRE, n = 10) group, concurrent endurance-resistance (CER, n = 10) group and control (C, n = 10) group (no training program). Concurrent training groups (CER and CRE) were conducted three times a week on alternate days for 8 weeks, which consisted of running with 70–75% of maximal heart rate (HRmax) for 10 minutes which gradually increased to 80% HRmax for 21.5 minutes and the resistance training consisted of 3 sets of 8 repetitions at 80% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) in 5 resistance exercises (leg extensions, lying leg curl, triceps pushdown, bench press and lateral pull down). Five minutes recovery duration was set between resistance and endurance phases. To measure hormonal and body composition changes, blood sampling was conducted 48 hours before the start of the course and again 48 hours after the last training session. Results Results using ANOVA with repeated measurement showed that there were no significant differences within groups and between groups for testosterone hormone. Serum levels of cortisol in both experimental groups were significantly increases after 8 weeks of concurrent training. While, there were significantly decreases in leptin and testosterone/cortisol ratio after 8 weeks training intervention in both experimental groups. Also, in the CRE and CER groups, a significant decrease observed in the body mass, body fat and body mass index. In addition, the control group did not change significantly in the posttest in none of the variables. Comparison between groups showed similarly that the CRE group compared with the control group, have a significant positive changes in all hormonal and body composition variables, however, no significant difference was observed between the CRE and CER groups. Conclusion It can be concluded that concurrent resistance and endurance training aimed at weight loss by reducing body fat in obese subjects can be a good strategy, although the both CRE and CER order were effective in positive transformation of serum leptin, testosterone, cortisol concentration and body composition. However, concurrent resistance-endurance (CRE) training may have better efficacy. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=111144750&site=ehost-live"

Methods: Sixty-three cyclists (peak oxygen uptake (...O2peak) 61.3 ± 5.8 mL⋅kg-1⋅min-1) were randomized to three training groups and instructed to follow a 12-wk training program consisting of 24 interval sessions, a high volume of low-intensity training, and laboratory testing. The increasing HIT group (n = 23) performed interval training as 4 x 16 min in weeks 1-4, 4 x 8 min in weeks 5-8, and 4 x 4 min in weeks 9-12. The decreasing HIT group (n = 20) performed interval sessions in the opposite mesocycle order as the increasing HIT group, and the mixed HIT group (n = 20) performed the interval prescriptions in a mixed distribution in all mesocycles. Interval sessions were prescribed as maximal session efforts and executed at mean values 4.7, 9.2, and 12.7 mmol-L ' blood lactate in 4 x 16-, 4 x 8-, and 4 x 4-min sessions, respectively (P < 0.001). Pre- and postintervention, cyclists were tested for mean power during a 40-min all-out trial, peak power output during incremental testing to exhaustion, ...O2peak, and power at 4 mmol⋅L-1 lactate. Results: All groups improved 5%--10% in mean power during a 40-min all-out trial, peak power output, and ...O2peak postintervention (P < 0.05), but no adaptation differences emerged among the three training groups (P > 0.05). Further, an individual response analysis indicated similar likelihood of large, moderate, or nonresponses, respectively, in response to each training group (P > 0.05). Conclusions: This study suggests that organizing different interval sessions in a specific periodized mesocycle order or in a mixed distribution during a 12-wk training period has little or no effect on training adaptation when the overall training load is the same.

Twenty-eight adolescent competitive cross-country skiers, including 10 females (age 17.9 ± 1.8 years; body mass 69.6 ± 9.7 kg; height 1.77 ± 0.1 m; training experience 8.6 ± 3.2 years) took part in this study. Pre-and post-intervention performance was measured with the incremental exercise test (Pmax) on a double poling ski ergometer. Changes in body composition were measured with DXA. In addition to regular endurance training, experimental group one (EXP1) performed maximal and explosive strength training two times per week, experimental group two (EXP2) performed maximal and explosive strength training 1–3 times per week, and the traditional (TRAD) group performed low intensity–high volume strength training 2 times per week. Increases in arm, trunk, and overall lean mass were found in TRAD (p < 0.05). Increases in arm lean-mass was found in EXP1 (p < 0.05), while no changes in body composition occurred in EXP2 (p ≥ 0.05). Pmax improved significantly in all groups (p < 0.05). Changes in body mass, overall and arm lean mass was related to changes in absolute performance (W; p < 0.05), while no relationships were found between changes in body composition parameters and relative performance (W/kg; p ≥ 0.05). In conclusion, different periodization of strength training led to similar improvements in double poling ergometer performance, but resulted in different changes in body composition (lean mass) in adolescent cross-country skiers.

Seventeen college-age men with previous resistance training experience performed 7 testing sessions with 48 hours recovery period between sessions. During each session, 4 consecutive sets of the bench press were performed with a 60% or 90% of one repetition maximum (1 RM) and with a 90-, 150-or 240- sec rest intervals between sets. The total repetitions completed and the sustainability of repetitions was compared between rest conditions and between loads. For each load, significant decline in repetition occurred between first and fourth set (p = 0.000). And the sustainability of repetitions was significantly different between loads (p = 0.000). A significant difference in the sustainability of repetitions occurred between all rest conditions, and 240- sec resting between sets resulted in sustainability grater total repetition vs. 150- sec (p = 0.000) and 90- sec resting between sets. When the training goal is maximal strength development, 240- sec should be taken between sets to avoid significant declines in repetitions, and when training to increase muscular endurance, 150-240 sec resting might be appropriate between consecutive sets.

Metabolic control, anthropometric parameters, lipid and hematological profiles, kidney and liver function markers, hormones, antioxidant enzymes, and oxidative stress markers were assessed prior to and after the training programs. At baseline, fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c in the ST group were higher than in the NT group; after the training, we no longer observed differences in these groups, suggesting an improvement on these parameters. In the AT group, catalase and superoxide dismutase activity, nitrite concentration, levels of sulfhydryl groups, and peak rate of oxygen consumption were elevated after the training ( p < 0.05). No changes were observed in antioxidant enzymes or oxidative stress markers in the ST group. The levels of sulfhydryl groups diminished in the NT group ( p < 0.01) and increased in the CBT group ( p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that the AT program for the T2DM subjects provided important upregulation in antioxidant enzymes and increased nitric oxide bioavailability, which may help minimize oxidative stress and the development of the chronic complications of diabetes. We propose that the beneficial effects observed in the metabolic parameters of the ST group occurred in response to the poor baseline metabolic health n this group, and not necessarily in response to the training itself.

Inflammatory and coagulation factors are among the various factors that are involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight weeks of combined training (endurance-intermittent resistance and endurance-continuous resistance) on coagulation, fibrinolytic and lipid profiles of overweight women. Material and Methods. This was a quasi-experimental study of 36 overweight women, who were divided into three groups of endurance-intermittent resistance training (n = 12), endurance-continuous resistance training (n = 12) and control (n = 12). The training was performed during eight weeks, three times a week, and each session lasted for 80 to 90 minutes. Blood samples were analyzed for the concentrations of coagulation, fibrinolytic and lipid profiles before and after the completion of the training program. Results. Fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and platelet count decreased significantly at the end of the training in both intervention groups. However, serum levels of D-dimer increased significantly in both training groups. Also, the levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased significantly, while the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased significantly. Conclusions. Combined exercise improved most coagulation factors and lipid profiles at the end of the training period. Therefore, the results of our research suggest that a combined exercise program can improve the health of overweight women.

Fourteen male cyclists performed tests assessing lower limb muscle FGC at rest (pre-test), as well as 6 and 24 hrs following CE performed on a mechanically-braked cycle ergometer. The CE consisted of 30 min at a workload corresponding to the lactate (Dmax) threshold and four 60 s rides at 120 percent VO2max with one min rest between each ride. At the completion of the CE a 6 or 24 hr recovery period was initiated, after which each subject's muscle FGC was measured. The analysis of lower limb muscle FGC include, (1) 6 s all-out cycle test; (2) a maximal isokinetic leg extension at 60, 120 and 180 degrees.s minus 1 and (3) a maximal concentric squat jump. Statistical analysis showed that compared to pre-test levels, a significant reduction in both isokinetic peak torque at 60 degrees .s minus 1, as well as maximum rate of force development (RFD) during the squat jumps. No significant differences were observed between isokinetic peak torque, maximum force or RFD pre-test and followed the 24 hr recovery period, indicating these tests had returned to normal by this time. No significant differences were found between peak power (PP) during the 6 s cycle test, pre-test and following either 6 or 24 hrs of recovery. These findings confirm earlier research that maximal voluntary strength is reduced for at least 6 hours following exhaustive dynamic exercise. The reduction in muscle FGC should be considered when resistance training is scheduled after endurance exercise.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-23820&site=ehost-live"

The study involved three training groups: LIFT subjects trained with free weights and Universal Gym equipment (Cedar Rapids, Iowa) three times per week, three sets of eight to 10 reps for 10 weeks; RUN subjects ran at 75 percent of HR max, three times per week; and COMBO subjects underwent both LIFT and RUN training. The VO2max, percent body fat, blood pressure and a resting ECG were taken on all subjects both before and after training. Strength measurements were made pre- and post- on the bench and leg press, and blood samples taken at rest (after a 12-hour fast) prior to the start of the training protocol and 48 hours after the last exercise session. The blood was centrifuged and the plasma analyzed (Sigma Kits, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri) for total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoproteins (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG). Low density lipoproteins (LDL-C) were calculated. Ten weeks of exercise training did not significantly alter TC, LDL-C or TG in any of the treatment groups, but did significantly reduce the HDL-C of the LIFT subjects. The low initial levels of TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and TG in the subjects and/or the relative shortness (10 weeks) of the training period were most likely responsible for the lack of change.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH280631&site=ehost-live"

S group training consisted of performing four leg presses, bench presses, pull down curls, and leg curls. During the first week, the training was performed at 50% of one repetition maximum (1RM) in 2 sets with 10 repetitions. The intensity of training increased to 80% 1RM in 3 sets and 6 repetitions during the 8th week. The SE training included the sum of the training performed by the E and S training groups. Left ventricular end diastolic and systolic diameters, post-wall thickness, left ventricular mass and mass index and septum wall thickness were measured by m-mode and 2-D echocardiography as the structural parameters. The end diastolic diameter in E and SE groups, the ventricular end systolic diameter, left ventricular mass and mass index of the SE group after the training increased (P≤0.05). In comparing the groups, only the increase of the end diastolic diameter in the SE group was significant (P≤0.05). The 8 weeks of concurrent training compared with endurance or resistance training alone resulted in a significant increase in left ventricular end diastolic diameter.

This systematic review aims to identify whether any mode of structured exercise improves physical fitness or performance-based tests of function and whether improvement in walking ability is related to an improvement in these outcomes. Data Sources and Study Selection: Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using an exercise intervention for the treatment of intermittent claudication with fitness (including the 6-min walk (6MW), aerobic capacity, shuttle and muscle strength) tests and performance-based tests of function as the outcomes. Study Appraisal and Methods: Assessment of study quality was performed using a modified version of the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale (PEDro). Relative effect sizes, mean differences (MDs) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated and adjusted via Hedges' bias-corrected for small sample sizes. Regression analyses were performed to establish relationships between walking ability and fitness outcomes. Results: Twenty-four RCTs met the inclusion criteria: 19 aerobic training interventions and 5 progressive resistance training (PRT). In total 924 participants (71 % male) were studied; with few participants over 75 years of age and the mean ankle brachial index was mean ± standard deviation (SD) 0.66 ± 0.06. The most common outcome measured was aerobic capacity (52 % of trials), which improved by 8.3 % ± 8.7 % on average. Although there were no significant relationships, up to 16 % of the variance in walking distances can be explained by changes in walking economy. Muscle strength was measured in only five trials, improving by 42 % ± 74 % on average. There was a strong significant relationship between change in plantar flexor muscle strength and change in initial claudication time ( r = 0.99; p = 0.001) and absolute claudication time ( r = 0.75; p = 0.05) measured on a treadmill across trials measuring this muscle group. The 6MW distance was measured in only 14 % of trials. Walking and PRT significantly improved 6MW initial claudication distance (MD range 52-129 m) and total walking distance (MD range 36-108 m) in studies that measured this outcome. Only one trial assessed performance-based tests of function, and they did not improve significantly. Conclusion: Although data are limited, there is a strong significant relationship between plantar flexor muscle strength and treadmill walking ability. More research is needed to assess improvements in walking economy at specific timepoints and whether this translates to improvements in claudication outcomes and measurements pertaining to muscle strength. Future trials should focus on interventions that improve lower limb muscle strength and assess muscle strength, power and endurance across a variety of lower extremity muscle groups in order to understand these relationships further. The 6MW, muscle strength and performance-based tests of function such as chair stand, balance scale, stair climb and gait speed are understudied in PAD. Future trials should examine the effects of exercise on performance-based tests of function, which may predict actual ADL performance and incident disability.

Eleven male (18-26 years) and eight female (18-27 years) were assigned to either a strength group (STR) ( n=9) or a control group (CON) ( n=10). STR performed strength training twice a week for 12 weeks in addition to their normal endurance training. STR improved 1 repetition maximum (RM) for seated pull-down and half squat (19±2% and 12±2%, respectively), while no change was observed in CON. Cross-sectional area (CSA) increased in m. triceps brachii for both STR and CON, while there was no change in the m. quadriceps CSA. VO during skate-rollerskiing increased in STR (7±1%), while VO during running was unchanged. No change was observed in energy consumption during rollerskiing at submaximal intensities. Double-poling performance improved more for STR than for CON. Both groups showed a similar improvement in rollerski time-trial performance. In conclusion, 12 weeks of supplemental heavy strength training improved the strength in leg and upper body muscles, but had little effect on the muscle CSA in thigh muscles. The supplemental strength training improved both VO during skate-rollerskiing and double-poling performance.

The purpose of this investigation was to assess LV systolic function before and after a simulated 2000-m rowing race on a Concept II rowing ergometer and evaluate these adaptations following 10 weeks of concurrent strength and endurance training. Furthermore, resting LV morphology was assessed prior to and following the 10-week training program. Ten male subjects underwent two-dimensional echocardiograms at rest, immediately following (95 +/- 27 s), as well as 5 and 45 minutes after, a simulated 2000-m rowing race. These measurements were also made before and after 10 weeks of training. Irrespective of testing time, performance of a 2000-m rowing race resulted in an increase in fractional area change (0.51 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.09; p &lt; 0.05) due to an increase in LV contractility. Concurrent strength and endurance training resulted in an increase in the resting LV diastolic cavity area (20.64 +/- 2.59 vs. 22.82 +/- 2.17 cm2; p &lt; 0.05), end systolic myocardial area (23.27 +/- 4.86 vs. 24.56 +/- 4.00 cm2; p &lt; 0.05) and LV mass (179.07 +/- 46.91 g vs. 210.46 +/- 51.13 g; p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that the acute increase in LV systolic function following a simulated 2000-m rowing race was due to heightened LV contractile reserve. Further, 10 weeks of combined strength and endurance training resulted in an increase in resting LV diastolic cavity size, wall thickness and mass.

Twenty-six female university rowers (age = 20 ± 1 year) were randomly assigned to H-load (5 novice, 8 varsity) or H-rep (7 novice, 6 varsity) groups. Subjects were pre- and posttested using a 2,000-m rowing ergometer test. Outcome variables included VO2 peak, time to test completion, total power, average power per stroke, total number of strokes, stroke rate, and body mass. Subjects trained for 8 weeks using identical exercises. Varsity rowers who performed H-load training demonstrated greater improvement compared with those who performed H-rep training. Novice rowers who performed H-rep training demonstrated greater improvement compared with those who performed H-load training. High-load periodized training appears to be more effective for athletes with advanced training status, and H-rep reverse step loading periodized training is more effective for those who are relatively untrained.

Forty-one elite young soccer players (body height: 174.0 ± 7.5 cm, body weight: 59.7 ± 9.5 kg, age: 14.6 ± 0.5 years, training age: 7.4 ± 0.6 years) underwent anthropometric measurements before performing 10m and 30m sprint tests, repeated sprint tests, and Yo-Yo IR1 and Yo-Yo IR2. The players were then divided into four groups: the SSG group (SSG; n=11), the SER group (SER; n=10), the CT group (CT; n=11), and the control group (CG; n=9). All groups performed training for six weeks on two days out of the five training days the participants were undertaking. There was a statistically significant increase in the Yo-Yo IR1 and Yo-Yo IR2 test performances of players in SSG, SER and CT groups (p<.05). In addition, players in these groups showed significantly higher percentage increases in Yo-Yo IR2 test performance compared to the CG. The CT group also had a statistically significant increase in Yo-Yo IR1 test performance compared to the CG (p<.05). In conclusion, while this study shows that SSG and SER training can be used for physical performance development in isolation or in combination, coaches and sports scientists are advised to choose combined training to use training time more efficiently.

The strength training was designed to improve one repetition maximum (1RM) with emphasis on nervous adaptations. Fifteen male cross-country skiers on regional level with a mean VO2max of 69.3 ml-kg-1 min-1 participated in the study. The strength group (n=7) performed maximal strength training for the upper body 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Each workout consisted of 3 sets; each with 6 repetitions and a workload set at 85% of 1RM, each session lasting 15 minutes. The strength testing induced 11% increase in 1RM and a 26% improved work economy. Time to exhaustion on maximal aerobic velocity for the strength group increased 25% more than the control group. There was not change in VO2max or VO2peak in either group. The results show that maximal strength training leads to increases in strength even when the amount of endurance training is high. Maximal strength training showed a positive effect on endurance performance with improved work economy without changes in VO2max, VO2peak or body weight.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-867205&site=ehost-live"

Fourteen sedentary college age males, divided equally into two groups, served as subjects. The seven subjects in the MRWT group completed 12, 1-hr bouts of weight lifting over a 4 week period, exercising on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week. Exercise sessions included 3 sets of 10 repetitions of the following lifts: bench press, overhead dumbbell press, dumbbell arm curl, and behind the neck pull down. The remaining seven subjects served as a non-training control group, whose purpose was to account for possible learning effects on the arm ergometer test that could distort the statistical relevance of the aerobic power data. These subjects did not serve as a control for the weight training exercises, as the procedures used to determine muscular strength may produce a modest training effect. Peak arm aerobic power and muscular strength, as measured by the one-repetition maximum for each lift, were determined before and after the training program. The average increase in strength for all lifts combined for the trained group was 20.0 percent. They also experienced a 13.4 percent increase in peak arm aerobic power, whereas there was no significant change in this variable for the control group. It is concluded that peak arm aerobic power is enhanced by the changes in muscular strength produced by 4 wks of MRWT.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH360986&site=ehost-live"

There is a strong correlation between tactile acuity and movement control suggesting these two treatments might have additive effects. The first research aim was to determine if patients with a motor control impairment demonstrated improvement in outcome with combined tactile acuity and motor control training. The second aim was to determine if tactile acuity training enhanced the effect of motor control training. Method The primary study was a single-arm cohort study conducted in three physiotherapy practices in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. 40 patients (23 males and 17 females) suffering from non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) and movement control impairment were treated. Patients were assessed at baseline and immediately post treatment. Treatment included exercises to lumbopelvic control and graphesthesia training to improve tactile acuity. Treatment effects were evaluated using the Roland Morris disability questionnaire (RMQ) and the patient-specific functional scale (PSFS). The performance on a set of six movement control tests and lumbar two-point discrimination were also assessed. The results of this cohort study were compared with a historic control group which was comparable with the primary study but included only motor control exercises. Results All the outcomes improved significantly with the combined training (RMQ – 2.2 pts., PSFS – 2.8 pts.; MCTB – 2.02 pts. & TPD – 17.07 mm; all p < 0.05). In comparison to the outcomes of the historic control, there was no significant differences in movement control, patient-specific functional complaints or disability between the groups. Conclusions The results of this study, based on a before and after intervention comparison, showed that outcome improved significantly following combined tactile acuity and motor control training. However, compared to an earlier study, the tactile acuity training did not have an additional effect to the results. The use of historical controls does not control for allocation bias and the results obtained here require verification in a randomized controlled trial.

The effect of normobaric hypoxia on resistance training adaptations in older adults. J Strength Cond Res 36(8): 2306–2312, 2022—The effect of normobaric hypoxia on strength, body composition, and cardiovascular fitness was investigated after a resistance training intervention in older adults. A single-blinded, randomized control trial recruited 20 healthy adults aged 60–75 years for an 8-week resistance training intervention in normoxia (n = 10) or normobaric hypoxia (14.4% O2; n = 10). Subjects performed 2 sessions per week of upper-body and lower-body exercises at 70% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM). Pretraining and post-training, maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max), muscular endurance (30 maximal knee flexions/extensions), and 5RM were assessed, with 5RM used to calculate 1RM. Subjects underwent whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at pretraining and post-training for fat and lean mass quantification. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Subjects in both groups substantially improved their calculated 1RM strength for leg extension, pectoral fly, row, and squat (normoxia; 30, 38, 27, and 29%, hypoxia; 43, 50, 28, and 64%, respectively); however, hypoxia did not augment this response. Hypoxia did not enhance V̇O2max or muscular endurance responses after the training intervention, with no improvements seen in either group. Fat mass and lean mass remained unchanged in both groups after the intervention. In summary, 8 weeks of resistance training in hypoxia was well tolerated in healthy older adults and increased upper-body and lower-body strength. However, the magnitude of strength and lean muscle improvements in hypoxia was no greater than normoxia; therefore, there is currently no evidence to support the use of hypoxic resistance training in older adults.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of progressive resistance training on leg strength, aerobic capacity and physical function in persons with Down syndrome (DS). Method. Thirty persons with DS (age 28 SD 8 years) were assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention group performed resistance training 2 days per week for 10 weeks. Participants performed tests to measure isometric and isokinetic knee extensor and flexor peak torque, peak aerobic capacity and timed performance on chair rise, walking and stair ascent and descent. Result. Persons with DS receiving the intervention significantly increased their isokinetic knee extensor and flexor peak torque [[Absolute change (post minus pre-value) was 17.0 SD 29.6 and 12.6 SD 18.9 N m, respectively]] and isometric knee extensor peak torque at angles of 45° (2.9 SD 23.2 N m), 60° (3.0 SD 22.9 N m) and 75° (14.2 SD 30.0 N m). These changes were significantly greater than in the control group. In addition, the time to ascend (−0.3 SD 0.8 s) and descend (−0.6 SD 0.9 s) stairs significantly decreased in the intervention group compared to the control group. Conclusion. These findings show that progressive resistance training is an effective intervention for persons with DS to improve leg strength and stair-climbing ability.

Methods: Twenty (M = 18; F = 2) highly skilled hockey players (age 15.9 ± 1.5 yr) completed 16 wk of standardized resistance and stability training supplemented with either off-ice simulated skating using the SkateSIM (SIM) or plyometric training (PLY) in a crossover design. Group 1 (PLY-SIM; N = 11) completed 8 wk of PLY followed by 8 wk of SIM. Group 2 (SIM-PLY; N = 9) completed 8 wk of SIM followed by 8 wk of PLY. Subjects completed on- and off-ice testing PRE, MID, and POST training. Results: Significant improvements in on-ice 35-m skating sprint (1.0%; P = .009) with significant improvements of 5% to 12% in various off-ice testing measures were observed PRE-MID in both groups. While few off-ice tests improved MID-POST, on-ice 35-m skating sprint times improved MID-POST by 2.3% (P = .000) with greater improvement in PLYSIM (3.5%) versus SIM-PLY (0.8%; P < .002). Off-ice 30-m sprint (r = 0.56; P = .010) and Edgren side shuffle (r = -0.46; P < .040) were the only off-ice tests that significantly correlated to improvements in on-ice skating sprint performance. Conclusion: The initial gains PRE-MID and then the lack of improvement in many off-ice tests from the MID-POST supports the principle of diminishing returns in response to standardized resistance training. The improvement in on-ice skating sprint performance when supplemental training progressed in specificity supports the principle of specificity and promotes transfer to a complex sporting movement such as skating.

In addition to cardiovascular function, these key performance indicators are believed to be partly dictated by the neuromuscular system. One technique to improve neuromuscular efficiency in athletes is through strength training. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to search the body of scientific literature for original research investigating the effect of strength training on performance indicators in well-trained endurance athletes-specifically economy, $$ {\text{v}}\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{2 \, \hbox{max} } /\,{\text{w}}\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{2 \, \hbox{max} } $$ and muscle power (vMART). Methods: A search was performed using the MEDLINE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science search engines. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria (athletes had to be trained endurance athletes with ≥6 months endurance training, training ≥6 h per week OR $$ \dot{V}{\text{O}}_{2 \, \hbox{max} } $$ ≥50 mL/min/kg, the strength interventions had to be ≥5 weeks in duration, and control groups used). All studies were reviewed using the PEDro scale. Results: The results showed that strength training improved time-trial performance, economy, $$ {\text{v}}\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{2 \, \hbox{max} } /{\text{w}}\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{2 \, \hbox{max} } $$ and vMART in competitive endurance athletes. Conclusion: The present research available supports the addition of strength training in an endurance athlete's programme for improved economy, $$ {\text{v}}\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{2 \, \hbox{max} } /{\text{w}}\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{2 \, \hbox{max} } $$ , muscle power and performance. However, it is evident that further research is needed. Future investigations should include valid strength assessments (i.e. squats, jump squats, drop jumps) through a range of velocities (maximal-strength ↔ strength-speed ↔ speed-strength ↔ reactive-strength), and administer appropriate strength programmes (exercise, load and velocity prescription) over a long-term intervention period (>6 months) for optimal transfer to performance.

A 10-week training program for both groups consisted of an endurance running program performed three afternoons per week. The CSE group also participated in strength training on the morning of each running session. Testing was conducted pre and post training in a 3-km time trial and measured VO2peak, running economy, muscular strength (1 repetition maximum), and body composition and girth. There was a trend (P = 0.07) toward greater improvement in 3-km performance time for the CSE group (106.7 +/- 91.4 seconds) when compared with the EO group (77.3 +/- 93.0 seconds). Further, the CSE group showed an increase in strength levels when compared with the EO group. The CSE group showed significant increases (P </= 0.05) in the parallel squat and hamstring curl, and a significant increase (P </= 0.05) was also found in upper body strength for the bench press (11.9% increase) when compared with the EO group. There were no significant differences between the two groups for VO2peak, running economy, body composition, or girth measurements. This study found no negative or compatibility problems when heavy strength training was added to an endurance running program, and a nonsignificant increase in improvement for 3-km times was evident.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of concurrent training incorporating either low-volume, high-intensity interval training (HIIT, 8-24 Tabata intervals at ~150% of VO2max) or high-volume, medium-intensity continuous endurance training (CT, 40-80 min at 70% of VO2max), on the strength and power of highly-trained individuals. Sixteen highly-trained ice-hockey and rugby players were divided into two groups that underwent either CT (n = 8) or HIIT (n = 8) in parallel with RT (2-6 sets of heavy parallel squats, > 80% of 1RM) during a 6-week period (3 sessions/wk). Parallel squat performance improved after both RT + CT and RT + HIIT (12 ± 8% and 14 ± 10% respectively, p < 0.01), with no difference between the groups. However, aerobic power (VO2max) only improved after RT + HIIT (4 ± 3%, p < 0.01). We conclude that strength gains can be obtained after both RT + CT and RT + HIIT in athletes with a prior history of RT. This indicates that the volume and/or intensity of the endurance training does not influence the magnitude of strength improvements during short periods of concurrent training, at least for highly-trained individuals when the endurance training is performed after RT. However, since VO2max improved only after RT + HIIT and this is a time efficient protocol, we recommend this type of concurrent endurance training.

Subjects (age 20.45 ± 1.99 years; height 173 ± 3.87 cm; Body fat 14.54 ± 2.52%) had a history of at least 3 to 6 months resistance training. The subjects were randomly divided into 3 groups; a control group (n=8), and two resistance training groups: a group using the sequence push with pull exercise pattern (n=8); and a group using the alternative push with pull exercises pattern (n=8). The subjects trained for 10 weeks with similar volume as the first two weeks with 60% 1RM (12 repetitions) that were terminated by the fifth two weeks with 80% 1RM (8 repetitions). 3 sessions per week consisted of 6 exercises leg extension, leg curl, rowing, bench press, biceps curl, and triceps extension. Before and after 10 weeks muscular endurance and strength were measured. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). When appropriate, Scheffe post hoc test comparisons were used to determine pair wise differences. Significance in this study was set at (P < 0.05). The results did not indicate any significant differences between the two training groups in strength and endurance on upper and lower body muscles. Also, there were no significant differences in weight, arm and thigh circumference (p ⋝ 0.05). Only differences were significant for biceps endurance and triceps endurance (P < 0.05). So, it can be concluded that both the training patterns cause to increase strength in sequence push with pull exercise and alternative push with pull exercises. However, probably alternative push with pull exercise is more appropriate than sequence push with pull exercises for increasing muscular endurance in biceps and triceps.

Methods: This observational case study tracked selected physiological measures, training intensity distribution, and total training load over the course of a 30-week concurrent training protocol. Furthermore, the athlete's performance profile during the ultra-endurance challenge was monitored with power output, cadence, speed, and heart rate recorded throughout. Results: Findings revealed considerable improvements in power output at a fixed blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol·L−1 (+25.7%), peak aerobic power output (+18.9%), power-to-mass ratio (+18.3%), relative peak oxygen uptake (+13.9%), gross mechanical efficiency (+4.6%), bench press 1-repetition maximum (+4.3%), and prone bench pull 1-repetition maximum (+14.9%). The athlete completed the 1407-km route in a new handcycling world record time of 89:55 hours. Average speed was 18.7 (2.1) km·h−1; cadence averaged 70.0 (2.6) rpm, while average power output was 67 (12) W. In terms of internal load, the athlete's average heart rate was 111 (11) beats per minute. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate how a long-term concurrent strength and endurance training program can be used to optimize handcycling performance capabilities in preparation for an ultra-endurance cycling event. Knowledge emerging from this case study provides valuable information that can guide best practices with respect to handcycling training for ultra-endurance events.

"The effectiveness of a pendulum swing for the development of leg strength and counter-movement jump performance.","Fowler, N.E.; Trzaskoma, Z.; Wit, A.; Iskra, L.; Lees, A.","Journal of Sports Sciences",="02640414",,="19950401","13","2","101","8","SPH374625",,,"Article","WEIGHT training; PLYOMETRICS; JUMPING; COMPARATIVE studies",,"Various training devices have been developed to facilitate 'plyometric' training, one such device being the 'pendulum swing'. To assess the effectiveness of the pendulum swing,the results of a 3 week training programme using a combination of pendulum swing and weight-training exercises were compared to those of a weight-training programe. Subjects were assigned to one of two groups (n=9) for weight-training only or for combined pendulum and weight-training. Both groups performed the same number of exercise repetitions. Measurements of isometric knee and hip extension-flexion, 1-RM squat weight, maximum jump height and power for a counter-movement jump were taken pre-training, 2 days after the end of the programme and 2 weeks after the end of the programme. The data were analysed using two-way MANOVA and MANCOVA techniques. Both methods showed significant increases in knee and hip extension strength. Hip and knee flexion strength increased only for the weight-trained group. Counter-movement jump height increased for both groups (weight-trained, P is less than 0.05; combined, P is less than 0.01). Maximum power increased only for the combined group. When the pre-training scores were used as a covariate, the weight-trained group showed a greater increase in hip flexion and extension strength and knee flexion strength than the combined training group. The combined group showed the greatest increase in knee extensor strength. It is concluded that the pendulum system induces a training effect which could be used to supplement weight-training for improving vertical jump performance.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH374625&site=ehost-live"

Fifty CAD patients (60.4 ± 9.9 years) were randomized to either a periodized training group (PG) (n = 25) or a non-periodized training group (NPG) (n = 25). Both consisted of a combined training programme, performed 3 days/week for 12 months. Thirty-six CAD patients (PG: n = 18, NPG: n = 18) successfully completed the exercise regimes. In both groups, a favourable main effect for time was evident for peak VO2, peak workload, anaerobic threshold and respiratory compensation point workloads and VO2, whole body skeletal muscle mass and quality index at 12 months. In conclusion, a periodized model is as effective as a non-periodized model in promoting increases in HRPF outcomes following a one-year intervention. These findings indicate that health-professionals can add variation to cardiac rehabilitation workouts without compromising effectiveness.

The S group increased right and left knee extension strength from 0-3, 3-6, and 0-8 weeks of training. The CR group did not increase right knee extension strength and increased left knee extension strength from 0-8 weeks. Both groups showed increases in knee flexion strength at every testing occasion except 3-6 weeks. The S group increased 1-RM leg press strength at each testing occasion, while the CR group improved 1-RM leg press at each testing occasion except 6-8 weeks.

Likewise, physiologic parameters may be improved through aerobic exercise. Methods: In order to compare the differences of a Pilates-Aerobic intervention program on physiologic parameters such as the maximum heart rate (HRmax), relative maximal oxygen consumption (relative VO2max) and absolute (absolute VOmax), maximum heart rate during maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max-HRmax), maximum minute volume (VE) and forced vital capacity (FVC), a total of 64 adult women (active group = 48.1 ± 6.7 years; control group = 47.2 ± 7.4 years) participated in the study. The physiological parameters, the maximal speed and total duration of test were measured by maximum exercise capacity testing through Bruce protocol. The HRmax was calculated by a cardio-ergometric software. Pulmonary function tests, maximal speed and total time during the physical test were performed in a treadmill (Medisoft, model 870c). Likewise, the spirometry analyzed the impact on oxygen uptake parameters, including FVC and VE. Results: The VO2max (relative and absolute), VE (all, P<0.001), VO2max-HRmax (P<0.05) and maximal speed of treadmill test (P<0.001) showed significant difference in the active group after a physical exercise interventional program. Conclusion: The present study indicates that the Pilates exercises through a continuous training program might significantly improve the cardiovascular system. Hence, mixing strength and aerobic exercises into a training program is considered the optimal mechanism for healthy aging.

Fourteen patients (means +/- SD: age: 56.2 +/- 8.6 yrs, body mass: 82.5 +/- 10.2 kg, VO2max: 25.2 +/- 5.7 ml.kg-l.min-1) participated in a supervised exercise program for a period of 8 months (two sessions of strength training: 60 % of one repetition maximum and two sessions of aerobic exercise: 60-85 % of HRmax) while thirteen patients (means +/- SD: age: 56.5 +/- 12.2 yr, body mass: 79.8 +/- 11.7 kg, VO2max: 24.9 +/- 6.5 ml.kg l.min-1) served as a control group. Body composition measurements, cardiopulmonary exercise stress-testing and maximum strength testing for six exercises were applied at the beginning and after four and eight months of the program. Data were analyzed with the two way ANOVA for repeated measures. Significant adaptations were observed in body composition, cardiovascular function and muscular strength after four months of training and further improvement was noticed at the end of the program. In particular, body weight (82.5 +/- 10.2 vs 79.8 +/- 8.8 kg, p &lt; 0.05) and the sum of skinfolds (56.2 +/- 10.1 vs 53.1 +/- 12.5 mm, p &lt; 0.05) significantly decreased. Exercise time (10.6 +/- 2.9 vs 12.1 +/- 2.7 min, p &lt; 0.05) and V02max (25.2 +/- 5.7 vs 29.1 +/- 6.3 ml.kg-l.min-l, p &lt; 0.05) were also significantly increased. Positive alterations were also found in the blood lipid profile including total cholesterol (202.2 +/- 26.2 vs 221.1 +/- 35.0 mg %, p &lt; 0.05), triglycerides (109.3 +/- 38.7 vs 129.6 +/- 58.2 mg %, p &lt; 0.05) and HDL-C (45.0 +/- 8.6 vs 42.7 +/- 10.6 mg %, p &lt; 0.05). Lower (57.2 +/- 4.2 vs 77.5 +/- 4.1 kg, p &lt; 0.05) and upper body strength (196.4 +/- 9.8 vs 246.6 +/- 9.4 kg, p &lt; 0.05) was also significantly increased at the end of the study. Patients in the control group did not reveal any significant alterations in the parameters measured during the eight-month follow-up. The above results indicate that a combined training program of strength and aerobic exercise of eight months induces positive adaptations on body composition, and improves cardiovascular function, lipid levels and muscular strength. These adaptations improves the clinical status of the patients and allows them to cope with daily tasks better and promotes their quality of life.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-826356&site=ehost-live"

Twenty-two subjects were assigned randomly to either an AT (n = 12) or a control (C, n = 10) group. Volunteers participated in a supervised shallow-water exercise program for 60 minutes a day, 3 days a week; the exercise program consisted of a 10-minute warm-up and stretching, 25 minutes of endurance-type exercise (dancing) at 80% of heart rate (HR)max, 20 minutes of upper- and lower-body resistance exercises with specialized water-resistance equipment, and a 5-minute cool down. Maximal isometric torque of knee extensors (KEXT) and knee flexors (KFLEX) were evaluated by a Cybex Norm dynamometer, grip strength (HGR) was evaluated using a Jamar hydraulic dynamometer, and dynamic strength was evaluated via the 3 repetition maximum (3RM) test for chest press, knee extension, lat pull down, and leg press. Jumping performance was evaluated using the squat jump (SJ), functional mobility with the timed up-and-go (TUG) test, and trunk flexion with the sit-and-reach test. Body composition was measured using the bioelectrical impedance method. The AT induced significant improvements in KEXT (10.5%) and KFLEX (13.4%) peak torque, HGR strength (13%), 3RM (25.7-29.4%), SJ (24.6%), sit-and-reach (11.6%), and TUG (19.8%) performance. The AT group demonstrated a significant increase in lean body mass (3.4%). No significant changes in these variables were observed in the C group. The results indicate that AT, with both aerobic and resistance components, is an alternative training method for improving neuromuscular and functional fitness performance in healthy elderly women.

The typical adult will lose muscle mass with age; the loss varies according to sex and the level of muscle activity. At the cellular level, muscles loose both cross-sectional area and fiber numbers, with type II muscle fibers being the most affected by aging. Some denervation of fibers may occur. The combination of these factors leads to an increased percentage of type I fibers in older adults. Metabolically, the glycolytic enzymes seem to be little affected by aging, but the aerobic enzymes appear to decline with age. Aged skeletal muscle produces less force and there is a general ""slowing"" of the mechanical characteristics of muscle. However, neither reduced muscle demand nor the subsequent loss of function is inevitable with aging. These losses can be minimized or even reversed with training. Endurance training can improve the aerobic capacity of muscle, and resistance training can improve central nervous system recruitment of muscle and increase muscle mass. Therefore, physical activity throughout life is encouraged to prevent much of the age-related impact on skeletal muscle.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH481205&site=ehost-live"

All subjects performed concurrent training aimed at increasing strength, power, speed, and energy-system fitness, as well as skill and team practice sessions, before and during the in-season period. The SRL group significantly improved 1 repetition maximum bench press (1RM BP) strength, but not bench throw (BT Pmax) or jump squat maximum power (JS Pmax) over their 19-week in-season. The results for the NRL group remained unchanged in all tests across their 29-week in-season. The fact that no reductions in any tests for either group occurred may be due to the prioritization, sequencing, and timing of training sessions, as well as the overall periodization of the total training volume. Having athletes better conditioned to perform concurrent training may also aid in reducing the possible interfering effects of concurrent training. Correlations between changes in 1RM BP and BT Pmax suggest differences in the mechanisms to increase power between stronger, more experienced and less strong and experienced athletes.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-779613&site=ehost-live"

However, the specific effects of intensive resistance-type training remain unclear. The main aim of this study was to find out whether an intensive 2-wk resistance training period affects the nocturnal HRV and strength performance of healthy participants. Methods: Young healthy men (N = 13, age 24 [2] y) performed 2-wk baseline training, 2-wk intensive training, and a 9-d tapering periods, with 2, 5, and 2 hypertrophic whole-body resistance exercise sessions per week, respectively. Maximal isometric and dynamic strength were tested at the end of these training periods. Nocturnal HRV was also analyzed at the end of these training periods. Results: As a main finding, the nocturnal root mean square of differences of successive R-R intervals decreased (P =.004; from 49 [18] to 43 [15] ms; 95% CI, 2.4–10.4; effect size = 0.97) during the 2-wk intensive resistance training period. In addition, maximal isometric strength improved slightly (P =.045; from 3933 [1362] to 4138 [1540] N; 95% CI, 5.4–404; effect size = 0.60). No changes were found in 1-repetition-maximum leg press or leg press repetitions at 80% 1-repetition maximum. Conclusions: The present data suggest that increased training load due to a short-term intensive resistance training period can be detected by nocturnal HRV. However, despite short-term accumulated physiological stress, a tendency of improvement in strength performance was detected.

The CombTG received 45 min conventional therapy for five days a week along with 45 min of BWSTT twice a week. The CTG received only conventional therapy for five days a week. The BWSTTG received only BWSTT twice a week. Training duration was six weeks for all groups. Primary outcome measures were the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), affected and non-affected side Single Leg Stance Test (e-SLST/n-SLST), and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) results. Secondary outcomes were the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI), Comfortable 10-m Walk Test (CWT), and Stair Climbing Test (SCT) results. Results: The mean change of outcome measures demonstrated that the improvements between groups were significantly different among the three groups, except for the CWT (p=0.135). In subgroup analysis, except for the RMI and CWT, all primary and secondary outcome measures improved significantly in favor of the CombTG, compared to the CTG and BWSTTG (p<0.016). However, no statistically significant difference was found in the mean change of the CTG and BWSTTG (p>0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that combined training has considerable effects on balance, mobility, and fear of falling parameters, while lower frequency of isolated BWSTT is as much effective as higher frequency of conventional training in ambulatory post-stroke patients.

Methods: Participants aged 17 years were randomly assigned to bCT (n = 11) or CT (n = 12). The 2 training interventions lasted 8 weeks with 2 sessions per week in replacement of some technical/tactical handball exercises and were matched for total training volume. Before and after training, tests were performed for the evaluation of proxies of muscle power (countermovement jump height, standing long-jump distance, and reactive strength index), muscle strength (back half-squat 1-repetition maximum), dynamic balance (Y-balance test), linear sprint speed (20-m sprint test), and change-of-direction speed (T test). Results: Two-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant group × time interactions for the reactive strength index (d = 0.99, P =.03) and Y-balance test score (d = 1.32, P <.01). Post hoc analysis indicated significant pre–post reactive strength index improvements in CT (d = 0.69, P =.04) only. For the Y-balance test, significant pre–post increases were found in bCT (d = 0.71, P =.04) with no significant changes in CT (d = 0.61, P =.07). In addition, significant main effects of time were observed for half-squat 1-repetition maximum, countermovement jump, standing long jump, and T test performance (d = 1.50 to 3.10, P <.05). Conclusions: Both bCT and CT interventions were effective in improving specific measures of physical fitness in young elite female handball players. If the training goal is to improve balance in addition, balance exercises can be conducted within a CT training session and prior to CT exercises.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether 16 weeks of combined exercise in postmenopausal would affect bone metabolism. Equipment and methods Eleven participants (53.1 [±4.0] years) performed combined training that consisted of 60–75% of 1 RM, 2–3 sets of 10–15 repetitions in specific machines and 20–30 min of cardiovascular exercises using an step platform (55–80% FCreserve). Cross-linked N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX) was used to analyze bone resorption and serum alkaline phos-phatase (ALP) to analyze bone absorption. Results After the training period, postmenopausal significantly ( P < 0.05) increase their muscle functionality (14% to 26.5%). Levels of NTX were not affected but there was a significant increase in bone synthesis (ALP: 12.5% to 15.9%), while there is no change in bone resorption. Combined training appears to be useful in improving total muscular performance and potentially in bone density.

Six men (68.94 ± 11.79 yrs old, 66.68 ± 7.36 kg, 167 ± 8.02 cm) and 6 women (64.07 ± 11.46 yrs old, 74.70 ± 12.89 kg; 160 ± 10.01 cm) with cancer were subjected to 20 wks of CT (3 d·wk-1). Each session consisted of 40 min of aerobic exercise (60 to 70%) of maximum heart rate and 3 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions at 50 to 60% of 1RM. The VO2 max was estimated by the 1 Mile Walk Test and strength was estimated through 1RM prediction. The Student t-test was used to identify differences between each assessment. Cohen's D criterion was used to calculate the effect size of the variables in the two moments, adopting the significance level of P<0.05. The results indicated that there was a significant increase (P<0.05) in strength in the following exercises: chair abductor (58.40 ± 11.90 vs. 73.05 ± 15.00); shoulder press (10.22 ± 5.30 vs. 17.63 ± 6.21); back lat pulldown (21.06 ± 4.99 vs. 27.36 ± 7.60); and peck-deck (32.91 ± 11.11 vs. 46.80 ± 14.58). There was no statistically significant change in VO2 max. Therefore, while the combined training resulted in an improvement in strength, it did not improve the cancer patients' aerobic capacity.

Thirty competitive male tennis players (mean age = 21.1 ± 0.1 yrs) were subjects in this study. All subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (a) Combined weight and pneumatic training group (CB; n = 10); (b) weight training group (WT; n = 10); and (c) control group (CO; n = 10). The subjects were tested for power endurance, peak power, and agility prior to the training, at the 4th and after the 8th wk of training. Both the CB and the WT groups performed identical training except that CB group used a pneumatic resistance (via cable) attached to an Olympic barbell loaded with plates; whereas, the WT group used just the Olympic barbell loaded with plates. Statistical analyses revealed significant (P<0.05) between-group differences after training. The results showed that the CB group significantly increased power endurance and peak power compared to the WT and the CO groups (P<0.05).

However, there are contradictions in the literature regarding the effects of concurrent training on hypertrophy at the myofiber level. Objective: The current study aimed to systematically examine the extent to which concurrent aerobic and strength training, compared with strength training alone, influences type I and type II muscle fiber size adaptations. We also conducted subgroup analyses to examine the effects of the type of aerobic training, training modality, exercise order, training frequency, age, and training status. Design: A systematic literature search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [PROSPERO: CRD42020203777]. The registered protocol was modified to include only muscle fiber hypertrophy as an outcome. Data Sources: PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus were systematically searched on 12 August, 2020, and updated on 15 March, 2021. Eligibility Criteria: Population: healthy adults of any sex and age; intervention: supervised, concurrent aerobic and strength training of at least 4 weeks; comparison: identical strength training prescription, with no aerobic training; and outcome: muscle fiber hypertrophy. Results: A total of 15 studies were included. The estimated standardized mean difference based on the random-effects model was − 0.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] − 0.46 to − 0.00, p = 0.050) for overall muscle fiber hypertrophy. The standardized mean differences were − 0.34 (95% CI − 0.72 to 0.04, p = 0.078) and − 0.13 (95% CI − 0.39 to 0.12, p = 0.315) for type I and type II fiber hypertrophy, respectively. A negative effect of concurrent training was observed for type I fibers when aerobic training was performed by running but not cycling (standardized mean difference − 0.81, 95% CI − 1.26 to − 0.36). None of the other subgroup analyses (i.e., based on concurrent training frequency, training status, training modality, and training order of same-session training) revealed any differences between groups. Conclusions: In contrast to previous findings on whole muscle hypertrophy, the present results suggest that concurrent aerobic and strength training may have a small negative effect on fiber hypertrophy compared with strength training alone. Preliminary evidence suggests that this interference effect may be more pronounced when aerobic training is performed by running compared with cycling, at least for type I fibers.

Dry-land is considered to be any training that swimmers undertake on land. Therefore the purpose of this article was to outline the mechanisms behind concurrent training (undertaking both resistance training and aerobic training in the same periodisation cycle), and to give a summary of dry-land training protocols that facilitate the transfer of strength to swim performance. This review shows that the combination of dry-land strength and in-water aerobic training is a common practice at elite and junior levels of the sport. However, evidence was inconclusive in determining whether concurrent aerobic and resistance, general hypertrophy, swim-specific cable pulley resistance, and power training improves swim performance in competitive swimmers. One explanation for this may be the inappropriate periodisation of strength and power training as decreases in neurological function during peak training phases (~8,300 metres per day) may not allow for optimal performance gains. It was found however that swim-specific strength training that targets push/pull shoulder movements and lower body triple extension whilst working to near maximal effort (80-90% 1RM) did allow for improvements in swim performance of sprint and middle distance swimmers. It was recommended that highly trained swimmers follow maximal strength prescriptions (3 sets x 5-6 reps, with 2-5min recovery) when the dry-land training goal is to improve swim performance. To optimise strength gains, it should also be noted that overall swim load should be reduced to no more than 5,000 metres per day to minimise the effects of neuromuscular fatigue.

We evaluated the effect of a 12-wk combined training intervention (resistance and aerobic exercise) on balance, walking ability, fatigue perception, quality of life, and severity of disease in patients with MS. The combined training was well tolerated by the patients and improved the quality of life of the patients as also reflected in the improvement in walking and balance ability as well as reduced depression, fatigue, and severity of disease. The results of this study confirm the beneficial effects of physical activity in patients with MS and support the use of a combination of resistance and aerobic exercise training to achieve functional and psychological therapeutic outcomes.

Methods: Sixty-seven healthy girls recruited from a Portuguese public high school (age: 13.5+1.03 years, from 7th and 9th grade) were divided into three experimental groups to train twice a week for 8 wks: GR (n=21), GCOM (n=25) and a control group (GC: n=21; no training program). Anthropometric parameters variables as well as performance variables (strength and aerobic fitness) were assessed. Results: No significant training-induced differences were observed in 1kg and 3kg medicine ball throw gains (2.7 to 10.8%) between GR and GCOM groups, whereas no significant changes were observed after a DT period in any of the experimental groups. Significant training-induced gains in CMVJ (8 to 12%) and CMSLJ (0.8 to 5.4%) were observed in the experimental groups. Time of 20m significantly decreased (GR: -11.5% and GCOM: -10%) after both treatment periods, whereas only the GR group kept the running speed after a DT period of 12 weeks. After training VO2max increased only slightly for GCOM (4.0%). No significant changes were observed after the DT period in all groups, except to GCOM in CMVJ and CMSLJ. Conclusion: Performing simultaneous strength and endurance training in the same workout does not appear to negatively influence power strength and aerobic fitness development in adolescent girls. Indeed, concurrent strength and endurance training seems to be an effective, well-rounded exercise program that can be prescribed as a means to improve initial or general strength in healthy school girls. De-training period was not sufficient to reduce the overall training effects. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=70838704&site=ehost-live"

Dietary protein ingestion supports skeletal muscle remodeling after exercise by stimulating the synthesis of muscle proteins and can optimize resistance exercise-training mediated increases in skeletal muscle size and strength; however, the effects of protein supplementation on acute and longer-term adaptive responses to concurrent resistance and endurance exercise are unclear. Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the effects of dietary protein supplementation on acute changes in muscle protein synthesis and longer-term changes in muscle mass, strength, and aerobic capacity in responses to concurrent resistance and endurance exercise in healthy adults. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in five databases: Scopus, Embase, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science. Acute and longer-term controlled trials involving concurrent exercise and protein supplementation in healthy adults (ages 18–65 years) were included in this systematic review. Main outcomes of interest were changes in skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates, muscle mass, muscle strength, and whole-body aerobic capacity (i.e., maximal/peak aerobic capacity [VO2max/peak]). The quality of studies was assessed using the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment for Controlled Intervention Studies. Results: Four acute studies including 84 trained young males and ten longer-term studies including 167 trained and 391 untrained participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. All included acute studies demonstrated that protein ingestion enhanced myofibrillar protein synthesis rates, but not mitochondrial protein synthesis rates during post-exercise recovery after an acute bout of concurrent exercise. Of the included longer-term training studies, five out of nine reported that protein supplementation enhanced concurrent training-mediated increases in muscle mass, while five out of nine studies reported that protein supplementation enhanced concurrent training-mediated increases in muscle strength and/or power. In terms of aerobic adaptations, all six included studies reported no effect of protein supplementation on concurrent training-mediated increases in VO2max/peak. Conclusion: Protein ingestion after an acute bout of concurrent exercise further increases myofibrillar, but not mitochondrial, protein synthesis rates during post-exercise recovery. There is some evidence that protein supplementation during longer-term training further enhances concurrent training-mediated increases in skeletal muscle mass and strength/power, but not whole-body aerobic capacity (i.e., VO2max/peak).

Purpose: To examine the effect of prior skills/endurance training and different recovery time periods on subsequent same-day RT performance in professional Australian football players. Methods: Sport-specific endurance-running loads (duration [in minutes], total distance [in meters], mean speed [in meters per minute], high-speed running >15 km·h−1, and relative high-speed running [>75% and >85% of maximal velocity]) were obtained for 46 professional Australian football players for each training session across an entire competitive season. RT was prescribed in 3 weekly mesocycles with tonnage (in kilograms) lifted recorded as RT performance. Endurance and RT sessions were interspersed by different recovery durations: ∼20 min and 1, 2, and 3 h. Fixed- and mixed-effect linear models assessed the influence of skills/endurance-running loads on RT performance. Models also accounted for season period (preseason vs in-season) and recovery duration between concurrent training bouts. Results: An increase in high-speed running and distance covered >75% and >85% of maximal velocity had the greatest reductions on RT performance. In-season total distance covered displayed greater negative effects on subsequent RT performance compared with preseason, while ∼20-min recovery between skills/endurance and RT was associated with greater reductions in RT performance, compared with 1-, 2-, and 3-h recovery. Conclusions: Sport-specific endurance-running loads negatively affect subsequent same-day RT performance, and this effect is greater in-season and with shorter recovery durations between bouts.

Aggregated mean effects for differential modes of exercise (aerobic exercise training (AET), resistance exercise training (RET), or combined (AET + RET)) were also calculated. Random effects models were used for all analyses. Results: Exercise significantly improved body fat percentage (Δ = 0.52, [95% CI: 0.16‐0.88] z = 2.81, P = 0.005, k = 4), aerobic capacity (Δ = 1.20, [0.52‐1.87] z = 3.48, P = 0.000, k = 8), endurance (Δ = 1.74, [0.94‐2.53] z = 4.03, P = 0.000, k = 10), strength (Δ = 1.27, [0.42‐2.11] z = 2.93, P = 0.003, k = 9), and power (Δ = 1.02, [0.52‐1.52] z = 4.00, P = 0.000, k = 2). Specifically, RET improved body fat percentage (Δ = 0.87, [0.38‐1.36] z = 3.47, P = 0.000, k = 2), aerobic capacity (Δ = 3.06, [2.37‐3.75] z = 8.65, P = 0.000, k = 2), endurance (Δ = 2.79, [1.48‐4.09] z = 4.19, P = 0.000, k = 6), strength (Δ = 1.44, [0.49‐2.39] z = 2.97, P = 0.002, k = 8), and power (Δ = 1.02, [0.52‐1.52] z = 3.99, P = 0.000, k = 2), while AET improved aerobic capacity (Δ = 0.69, [0.24‐1.15] z = 3.01, P = 0.000, k = 3), and AET + RET improved aerobic capacity (Δ = 0.52, [0.15‐0.89] z = 2.78, P = 0.005, k = 3) and endurance (Δ = 0.44, [0.19‐0.70] z = 3.41, P = 0.000, k = 3). Conclusions: The present results provide evidence of the positive effects of exercise interventions, particularly RET, to improve outcomes of health and fitness associated with superior job performance and reduced risk of injury and CVD.

The 6-min walk test (6MWT), timed up-and-go test (TUG) and the sit-to-stand test (STS) are reliable measures of physical function in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Outcome measures allow physiotherapists to monitor changes in physical function with exercise prescription. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Scopus databases and reference lists of relevant reviews were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relating to exercise and T2D published until June 2020. Studies were included when: (a) participants were adults diagnosed with T2D, (b) exercise was a main intervention and compared to controls, and (c) at least one clinical physical function measure was used to detect changes in aerobic capacity, mobility or strength. Eight of 10 RCTs reported either statistically significant between-group (p < 0.05) or within-group (p < 0.05) differences in 6MWT scores. Nonsignificant between-group differences were found in two resistance training RCTs that utilized the TUG test. Three of five RCTs utilizing the STS test reported significant between groups differences (p < 0.05). Seven of 11 RCTs reported statistically significant between-group (p < 0.05) or within-group (p < 0.05) differences in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Physical function measures may be useful for monitoring aerobic capacity, lower extremity strength and mobility with exercise in patients with T2D. Improvements in 6MWT scores may depend on total volume of exercise (minutes/week ∗ weeks of intervention). However, changes in HbA1c with exercise were variable and may depend on type of exercise. • Exercise interventions improve physical function in patients with type 2 diabetes. • Increased total volume of exercise improves 6-min walk test scores. • Glycated hemoglobin improves with combined aerobic and resistance training. • Physiotherapists can directly manage type 2 diabetes with exercise prescription.

There are many training methods designed to optimize athletic performance. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is one method of athletic performance training that has been found effective in increasing certain physiologic variables such as VO2max. It is unknown if HIIT has positive effects on objective measures of athletic performance. Objective: To systematically review the effects of HIIT on objective, athletic performance measures. Method: A systematic review of literature indexed in the following databases: Medline, CINAHL, SportsDiscus, and PubMed was conducted. The methodological quality of the studies was graded using the PEDro scale. Results: Fourteen studies satisfied the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Methodological scores based on the PEDro scale were 4/10-7/10. HIIT resulted in improvements in running: 3000 and 5000 m track time (TT), (p = 0.04, p < 0.05, respectively) and 40-m sprint TT (p = 0.091), rowing: 2000-m TT (p = 0.02), cycling increase in 5 mile time trial (p < 0.05), softball significant increase in peak pitch velocity (3%), and hockey skating 33 m sprint (p < 0.05). HIIT training was not significant for swimming endurance trials (p = 0.97). Although HIIT had significant effects on many outcome measures, it was not always more effective than other methods. Conclusion: The findings of this review indicate that HIIT can have beneficial effects on certain athletic performance measures. Although varying HIIT dosages were found effective, there is no clear indication of what HIIT prescription is most effective for specific sports activities.

The popularity of kettlebell training appears to be based on anecdotal reports rather than on scientific evidence supporting training effects. Objective: To systematically review the effects of kettlebell training on strength, power, and endurance. The systematic review will also examine any adverse events associated with kettlebell training. Methods: A systematic review of literature indexed in the following databases: Medline, CINAHL, SportsDiscus, ProQuest, PEDro, and PubMed, was conducted. The quality of the studies was graded using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale (PEDro). Results: Five studies satisfied the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. The populations studied age range was 18-72 years old. Methodological scores based on the PEDro scale ranged from 3 to 7 out of 10. Kettlebell training demonstrated improvements for a number of strength measures: timexgroup for bench press (P<0.05) and back extension (P<0.053), main effect for clean and jerk (P<0.05) and certain power measures such as improved explosive strength comparable to a jump squat control (19.8% increase). Improved postural control was demonstrated in one study (P=0.04). Kettlebell training did not have an effect on aerobic endurance as measured by VO2 max. No adverse events were reported in any of these studies. Conclusions: Moderate evidence indicates that kettlebell training may be safe and effective for increasing certain functional strength and power measures and may show positive results with postural control in young, healthy populations. Kettlebell training has not been found to be efficacious in increasing aerobic endurance.

This investigation examines the effects of running training performed with or without BFR on physiology and performance.<bold>Method: </bold>Sixteen subjects (age 24.9 ± 6.9 years, height 172.9 ± 7.8 cm, weight 75.1 ± 13.8 kg) were assigned to a BFR or control (CON) group for eight sessions of training. Before and after training, subjects completed an incremental test to determine peak running velocity (PRV) maximal oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) and running economy (RE), followed by a time to exhaustion run (TTE) performed at PRV.

Running economy improved in the BFR group but not in CON (ES = 0.4). TTE also increased in both BFR (27 ± 9%) and CON groups (17 ± 6%) with a small (ES = 0.31) additional benefit in favour of the BFR group.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Using BFR during training appears to confer small but potentially worthwhile improvements in RE, PRV and TTE measures. The improvements following BFR training are likely due to muscular rather than cardiovascular function.

Objective: This review provides a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the literature that tested the hypothesis that protein supplements accelerate gains in muscle mass and strength resulting in improvements in aerobic and anaerobic power. Evidence statements were created based on an accepted strength of recommendation taxonomy. Data Sources: English language articles were searched through PubMed and Google Scholar using protein and supplements together with performance, exercise, strength, and muscle, alone or in combination as keywords. Additional articles were retrieved from reference lists found in these papers. Study Selection: Studies recruiting healthy adults between 18 and 50 years of age that evaluated the effects of protein supplements alone or in combination with carbohydrate on a performance metric (e.g., one repetition maximum or isometric or isokinetic muscle strength), metrics of body composition, or measures of aerobic or anaerobic power were included in this review. The literature search identified 32 articles which incorporated test metrics that dealt exclusively with changes in muscle mass and strength, 5 articles that implemented combined resistance and aerobic training or followed participants during their normal sport training programs, and 1 article that evaluated changes in muscle oxidative enzymes and maximal aerobic power. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: All papers were read in detail, and examined for experimental design confounders such as dietary monitoring, history of physical training (i.e., trained and untrained), and the number of participants studied. Studies were also evaluated based on the intensity, frequency, and duration of training, the type and timing of protein supplementation, and the sensitivity of the test metrics. Results: For untrained individuals, consuming supplemental protein likely has no impact on lean mass and muscle strength during the initial weeks of resistance training. However, as the duration, frequency, and volume of resistance training increase, protein supplementation may promote muscle hypertrophy and enhance gains in muscle strength in both untrained and trained individuals. Evidence also suggests that protein supplementation may accelerate gains in both aerobic and anaerobic power. Limitations: To demonstrate measureable gains in strength and performance with exercise training and protein supplementation, many of the studies reviewed recruited untrained participants. Since skeletal muscle responses to exercise and protein supplementation differ between trained and untrained individuals, findings are not easily generalized for all consumers who may be considering the use of protein supplements. Conclusions: This review suggests that protein supplementation may enhance muscle mass and performance when the training stimulus is adequate (e.g., frequency, volume, duration), and dietary intake is consistent with recommendations for physically active individuals.

Both groups received a training program of 9 weeks. The total training volume for both groups was the same (E: 8.8 (1.1) h/week; C: 8.9 (1.7) h/week), but 37 % of training for E consisted of explosive-type strength training, whilst C received endurance training only. Simulated time trial performance (TT), short-term performance (STP), maximal workload (Wmax) and gross (GE) and delta efficiency (DE) were measured before, after 4 weeks and at the end of the training program (9 weeks). No significant group-by-training effects for the markers of endurance performance (TT and Wmax) were found after 9 weeks, although after 4 weeks, these markers had only increased (P &lt; 0.05) in E. STP decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in C, whereas no changes were observed in E. For DE, a significant group-by-training interaction (P &lt; 0.05) was found, and for GE the group-by-training interaction was not significant. It is concluded that replacing a portion of endurance training by explosive strength training prevents a decrease in STP without compromising gains in endurance performance of trained cyclists.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-801105&site=ehost-live"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 10 weeks of resistance and endurance exercise training on the serum levels of nesfatin-1, HSP70 and insulin resistance (IR) in women with type 2 diabetes. Materials and Methods 26 women with type 2 diabetes were selected using purposive sampling and were randomly divided into three groups. 10 subjects participated in the resistance training group (3 sessions per week, exercising with 30–80% of one repetition maximum (1RM)), 8 subjects participated in the endurance training group (3 sessions per week, exercising with 40–80% of maximum heart rate (HR max), for 20–45 minutes), and 8 subjects were placed in the control group who did not engage in any physical exercise during the study period. Blood samples were collected after a 12 hour [overnight] fast in order to evaluate nesfatin-1, HSP70, insulin and glucose levels in the pre- and post-tests. The obtained data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, paired-samples t-test, one-way ANOVA and LSD post-hoc test in SPSS software, version 21 at the significance level of α <0.05. Results There was a significant increase in nesfatin-1 levels and a significant decrease in HSP70 levels of the resistance training group, (P < 0.05), whereas no significant changes were observed in nesfatin-1 and HSP70 levels of the endurance training group (P > 0.05). Glucose levels, insulin resistance (HOMA1-IR) and body composition indices (except for WHR) significantly decreased in both training groups (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant changes in insulin levels of the training groups (P > 0.05). Moreover, comparing the pre- and post-test levels of glucose changes, a significant difference was observed in the resistance and endurance training groups but not in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion Resistance and endurance training are recommended as complementary therapy for women with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Twenty-seven haemodynamically stable male cardiac patients (age range 39-66 years) performed 3 weeks (6 sessions) of aerobic exercise 2x/week before being randomly assigned to one of three groups: aerobic only (AO; n=10) early-start resistance training (ESRT; n=8) and late-start resistance training (LSRT; n=9). All three groups participated in 16 weeks (32 sessions) of aerobic exercise, however, the ESRT and LSRT groups performed 12 and 6 weeks (24 or 12 sessions respectively) of moderate-high intensity (70-79% of 1RM) weight training (7 exercises). There were no haemodynamic complications due to the RT over the course of the study. Body composition was measured using anthropometric girths, sum of skinfolds (SOS), body weight (BW), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), Near Infrared Photospectometry (NIR) and Dual- Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). DXA measures were only done for 14 subjects (AO & LSRT, n=4; ESRT, n=6) and due to the small group numbers results were used as supplemental information. MM was calculated from a regression equation based on skinfold-corrected limb girths. Results: A 3 (Group) X 4 (Time) ANOVA with repeated measures on the last factor, indicated no significant changes for the group effect in BW (p=0.6) and SOS (P=0.9), DXA & NIR LM (both p=0.6); DXA & NIR FM (p=0.4 & p=0.9, respectively) or MM (p=0.2), or individual girths. However, a significant difference occurred for the time factor for WHR (F3,72=5.4, p less than .002) and for waist girths (F3,72=4.02, p less than .01) with no changes to hip girths (p=0.7) or umbilicus skinfolds (p=0.9) suggesting a decrease in subjects' visceral fat. The group X time factor showed significance for the DXA LM (F2,11=5.7; p less than .02), and MM (F6,72=5.1, p less than .001) indicating that changes in response to the RT interventions over time were dissimilar between the groups at specific assessment periods. The AO group lost 2 +/-1.5% DXA LMpre-to-post and 3.3 +/-2.1% MM while the ESRT and LSRT groups gained DXA LMESRT 3.9% +/-1% and MMESRT 4.0 +/-1.4% MM and DXA LMLSRT .8 +/-1.1% and MMLSRT 4.0 +/-1.4%. Overall pre-to post-training strength changes were significantly different (F2,22=9.5, p less than .001) between groups with the greatest changes occurring in the ESRT group (27+/-4.2%) followed by the LSRT group (25 +/-3.3%) and then the AO group (7.3 +/-2.6%). A post-hoc Tukey HSD analysis revealed the significant difference to be between the RT and AO groups (p less than 0.05); no significant difference existed between the two RT groups (p=.35). Upper and lower body pre-to post training strength changes were significantly different (F2,22=5.8, p less than .009 and F2,22=7.4, p less than .004, respectively) with the upper body increasing 6.5%AO, 17.9% ESRT, 18.4% LSRT and lower body increasing 7.5%AO, 39.0%ESRT, 33.8%LSRT. Conclusions: RT significantly increased strength with the greatest gains occurring in subjects who started RT earlier rather than later in the cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP). However, there were no significant strength differences between the ESRT and the LSRT groups suggesting that RT can begin as late as 10 weeks after starting a CRP and show similar strength gains to those who start RT earlier. There were no significant changes in body composition between groups, however, the AO group showed a numerical loss in MM and DXA LM while the RT groups showed a numerical increase in these variables. A statistically significant group X time interaction effect for MM (p less than .001) and DXA LM (p less than .02) suggests that RT maintains or increases MM and DXA LM, while AO exercise actually caused losses in these variables. WHR for all groups significantly decreased over time regardless of training intervention suggesting that RT may not play a primary function on WHR changes. WHI changes were due to a loss in waist girths suggesting a loss in visceral fat. The primary goal of a CRP is to return the patient to a normal life as quickly as possible, RT can play a vital role in this process. RT can begin as early as 4 weeks post-cardiac event with minimal risk of haemodynamic complications in selected low-moderate risk cardiac patients. RT has many physiological benefits and by incorporating it earlier in a CRP, cardiac patients have an opportunity to incur these benefits sooner. This may then facilitate a quicker return to work and leisure activities.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-75968&site=ehost-live"

"THE EFFECTS OF RESISTANCE TRAINING ON SPRINT AND ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE IN MASTERS ATHLETES: A NARRATIVE REVIEW.","Delvecchio, Luke; Korhonen, Marko T.; Reaburn, Peter","Journal of Fitness Research",="22015655",,="20160401","5","1","5","9","116594626",,,"Article","ATHLETES; PHYSICAL fitness; CYCLING",,"Participation of masters athletes (>30 years) in sprint running (100-400 m) and sprint track cycling (200 m, team sprint, 1-km) has increased significantly over recent decades. With aging, sprint and endurance performance gradually declines. The present review focuses upon the effects of resistance training on sprint and endurance performance and its physiological determinants in masters athletes. The available research demonstrates that resistance training interventions in masters athletes lead to beneficial adaptations in both sprint and endurance athletes. With inclusion of heavy strength training exercises in sprinters' training regimen, increases muscle mass, size of fast fibres and rapid neural activation capacity along with improvements in maximal, explosive and sprint force production have been observed. In endurance athletes, strength training has been shown to lead to increased maximal and explosive muscle strength levels. The actual event-specific performance changes are typically smaller, but significant (p<0.05), with a 2-4% reduction in sprint running times and 3-6% improvement in endurance cycling and running economy. Taken together, these limited data suggest that resistance training programs produce positive effects on physiological determinants of sprint and endurance performance that result in enhanced sport performance capacity in masters athletes. Further research on these issues is needed to design and deliver optimal training programs to aging athletes.

The participants in this study (N=12) had a mean weekly aerobic training time of 7.5 hours per week of swimming, cycling, or running. Eight subjects were assigned to a pulmonary resistance treatment group and four control subjects were given a sham device that allowed no greater than 15% resistance on inspiration or expiration. The subjects performed 30 maximal inhalation/exhalation maneuvers on their respective devices two times per day for four weeks. The subjects were tested for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, forced inspiratory vital capacity (FIVC), peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Each subject was also tested for peak exhalation force (PEF) as well as a maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), tidal volume (VT), ventilation (VE), ventilatory threshold (VT), and respiration rate (RR). The data revealed that training using the pulmonary resistance device produced significant increases in maximal VE and maximal VT while decreasing RR (although not statistically significant) at maximum exercise. However, no significant changes were seen in VO2 or any pulmonary function variables measured.

Methods: 16 moderately trained recreational endurance runners were tested for CV, ARD, and TT performances on 3 separate occasions (baseline, midstudy, and poststudy). Design: Participants were randomly allocated into a strength and conditioning group (S & C; n = 8) and a comparison endurance-training-only group (EO; n = 8). During the first phase of the study (6 wk), the S&C group performed concurrent maximal strength and endurance training, while the EO group performed endurance-only training. After the retest of all variables (midstudy), both groups subsequently, during phase 2, performed another 6 wk of endurance-only training that was followed by poststudy tests. Results: No significant change for CV was identified in either group. The S&C group demonstrated a significant decrease for ARD values after phases 1 and 2 of the study. TT performances were significantly different in the S&C group after the intervention, with a performance improvement of 3.62%. This performance increase returned close to baseline after the 6-wk endurance-only training. Conclusion: Combining a 6-wk resistance-training program with endurance training significantly improves 5-km TT performance. Removing strength training results in some loss of those performance improvements. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=112512275&site=ehost-live"

New evidence also indicates that statin use can directly compromise aerobic exercise capacity; however, we are just beginning to understand the interactions of statins with exercise training and adaptations. This review focuses on the interactions of statins with aerobic exercise capacity and training adaptations to summarize the available information and draw attention to the gaps in our current knowledge in this area. PubMed, Web of knowledge, and Google scholar databases were searched between January 2000 and December 2013 using the following terms and their combinations: statins, exercise, aerobic capacity, endurance training, adaptations. The reference lists of the relevant articles were also scanned for additional information. Considering the widespread use of statins and the need for exercise for cardiovascular health, a better understanding of the interactions of these interventions as well as practical solutions are needed to reduce statin adverse effects associated with exercise.

Fourteen trained and moderately trained male runners performed strength training prior to running sessions (SR) and running prior to strength training sessions (RS) with each mode of training session separated by 6 h. RE tests were conducted at baseline (Base-RE) and the day following each sequence to examine cost of running (CR), TTE, and lower extremity kinematics. Maximal isometric knee extensor torque was measured prior to and following each training session and the RE tests. Results showed that CR at 70% and 90% VT for SR-RE (0.76 ± 0.10 and 0.77 ± 0.07 mL·kg-0.75·m-1) was significantly greater than Base-RE (0.72 ± 0.10 and 0.70 ± 0.11 mL·kg-0.75·m-1) and RS-RE (0.73 ± 0.09 and 0.72 ± 0.09 mL·kg-0.75·m-1) ( P < 0.05). TTE was significantly less for SR-RE (237.8 ± 67.4 s) and RS-RE (275.3 ± 68.0 s) compared with Base-RE (335.4 ± 92.1 s) ( P < 0.01). The torque during the SR sequence was significantly reduced for every time point following the strength training session ( P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in torque following the running session ( P > 0.05), although it was significantly reduced following the strength training session ( P < 0.05) during the RS sequence. These findings show that running performance is impaired to a greater degree the day following the SR sequence compared with the RS sequence.

Twenty-one endurance-trained, female cyclists, aged 18-42 yr, were randomly assigned to either a resistance training (RT; N = 14) or a control group (CON; N = 7). Resistance training (2X.wk-1) consisted of five sets to failure (2-8 RM) of parallel squats for 12 wk. Before and immediately after the resistance-training period, all subjects completed an incremental cycle test to allow determination of both their lactate threshold (LT) and peak oxygen consumption VO). In addition, endurance performance was assessed by average power output during a 1-h cycle test (OHT), and leg strength was measured by recording the subject's one repetition maximum (1 RM) concentric squat. Before and after the 12-wk training program, resting muscle was sampled by needle biopsy from m. vastus lateralis and analyzed for fibre type diameter, fiber type percentage, and the activities of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and phosphofructokinase. After the resistance training program, there was a significant increase in 1 RM concentric squat strength for RT (35.9 %) but not for CON (3.7 %). However, there were no significant changes in OHT performance, LT, VO2, muscle fiber characteristics, or enzyme activities in either group. The present data suggest that increased leg strength does not improve cycle endurance performance in endurance-trained, female cyclists.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-59670&site=ehost-live"

Given this, no sufficient evidence found to explain the effect of combining aerobic and resistance training (CART) in a workout on obese adults. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of CART in a workout on weight loss, anthropometric and body composition, blood and metabolic variables, aerobic and strength fitness.70 obese Ethiopian adults (63M, 7F, age range: 33-56yr) screened and recruited for the study. Subjects randomly divided into intervention and control group. Aerobic exercises performed before resistance exercises in all time. Baseline and after 12 weeks test were done on weight, anthropometric, Body composition, fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol, blood pressure, VO2max and Total 1RM. Data was analyzed by SPSS statistical package software (version 16.0 for window). 85.7 %( n=60) of the participants (30 exerciser and 30 control) completed the study. The interventions showed significant (p<0.001) reduction on body weight (6.1%), WC (3.8%), BMI (6.3%), percent body fat (11.6%), systolic (1.97%) and FBG (5.9%) and total cholesterol (4.3%). Significant (p<0.001) greater increasing change resulted on Skeletal muscle (10.4%), running time (59.5%), VO2max (71.5 %) and total 1RM (26.3%). In conclusion, intervening CART for 12 weeks resulted significant improvement on weight loss, body composition and metabolic variables and cardiorespiratory and muscular strength in obese participants.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of a physical exercise multicomponent training based on exergames on cognitive functioning (CF) in older adults. Research Design and Methods: This randomized controlled trial included older adults aged 61–78. Participants were randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG; n = 15) or active control group (CG; n = 16). The IG was exposed to a combined training with traditional exercise and exergaming, twice a week over a period of 12 weeks. The CG performed only traditional sessions. CF was assessed by the Cognitive Telephone Screening Instrument. The time points for assessment were at zero (pretest), 12 (posttest), and 17 weeks (follow-up). Results: Active CG and IG increased from pretest to posttest in short-term memory (STM), long-term memory (LTM), and Cognitive Telephone Screening Instrument total score 1.98 > Z < 3.00, ps <.005, with moderately large positive effects (.36 > r <.54). A significant increase was seen from posttest to follow-up in STM, Z = 2.74, p =.006, and LTM, Z = 2.31, p <.021, only in IG. Across the two time periods posttest to follow-up, there were significant interaction effects between program type and time for STM (p =.022, η p 2 =.17) and LTM (p =.004, η p 2 =.25), demonstrating a more beneficial effect of the exergames intervention compared to the CG. Discussion and Implications: The integration of exergaming in a multicomponent functional fitness exercise might have the potential to maintain and improve CF (in particular, STM and LTM) in older adults.

Twenty-four well-trained male cyclists were randomised to 3 independent groups receiving 20 g protein hydrolysate, iso-caloric carbohydrate, or low-calorific placebo supplementation, per serve. Supplement serves were provided twice daily, from the onset of the muscle-damaging exercise, for a total of 4 days and in addition to a controlled diet (6 g·kg−1·day−1 carbohydrate, 1.2 g·kg−1·day−1 protein, remainder from fat). Following the concurrent exercise session at time-point 0 h, comprising a simulated high-intensity road cycling trial and 100 drop-jumps, recovery of outcome measures was assessed at 24, 48, and 72 h. The concurrent exercise protocol was deemed to have caused exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), owing to time effects ( p < 0.001), confirming decrements in maximal voluntary contraction (peaking at 15% ± 10%) and countermovement jump performance (peaking at 8% ± 7%), along with increased muscle soreness, creatine kinase, and C-reactive protein concentrations. No group or interaction effects ( p > 0.05) were observed for any of the outcome measures. The present results indicate that protein supplementation does not attenuate any of the indirect indices of EIMD imposed by concurrent exercise, when employing great rigour around the provision of a quality habitual diet and the provision of appropriate supplemental controls.

Limited research has been conducted that investigates the effect of a supervised strength and aerobic training program on muscular strength and aerobic capacity in people with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this 1-group repeated-measures-designed study was to investigate the impact of a supervised strength and aerobic training program on muscular strength and aerobic capacity in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Thirteen subjects with type 2 diabetes completed the training program. Subjects met the American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes. For each subject, muscular strength (estimated 1 repetition maximum) and aerobic capacity (esti- mated maximal oxygen uptake) were measured before and after a supervised strength and aerobic training program as well as during a 6-week follow-up. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare muscular strength and aerobic capacity between pretesting, posttesting, and follow-up testing periods. Significant improvements in muscular strength (p > 0.01) and aerobic capacity (p > 0.01) were found during posttesting and follow-up testing, as compared to pretesting measures. Yet a significant loss in muscular strength (p > 0.01) and no significant change in aerobic capacity (p > 0.05) were found during follow-up testing, as compared to posttesting measures. This study indicates that a supervised strength and aerobic training program can significantly improve muscular strength and aerobic capacity in people with type 2 diabetes. Yet improvements in muscular strength due to training will not be maintained if individuals with type 2 diabetes do not adhere to a continuous training program. In addition, aerobic capacity can be improved with training, but aerobic capacity will not continue to improve if people with type 2 diabetes are not compliant with a continuous training program.

The tested group consisted of 12 athletes: 6 cyclists and 6 weightlifters, with II and I sport group, practising for at least 4 years. In the weightlifters' group predominant training load was directed at strength, whereas in the cyclists' group priority was to form endurance capabilities. All athletes were tested during the competition period. The control group consisted of 30 persons, who practiced motor activity for 1-2 hours a week whereas their activity was connected with everyday routines (climbing the stairs, walking etc). The microcirculation was measured using Doppler laser flowmeter Perifluks 4001 (Perimed, Sweden). Rest flow, hyperaemic, hyperthermic and orthostatic reactivity of skin microcirculation and maximal minute oxygen uptake (VO2max), were evaluated. Apart from frequency, the signal power was also analyzed. Beside biological zero, all other measured parameters were stati- stically significant higher in the cyclists (RF-35,33 ± 3,25 PU; BZ-2,97 ± 0,24 PU; PORH MAX-150,67 ± 10,14 Pu; TH MAX-278,94 ± 60,22 Pu; OR-57,06 ± 3,1%, VO2max-66,11 ± 7,01 ml/kg/min), compared with the both group: weightlifters and control group (weightlifters: RF-16,01 ± 3,53 PU; BZ-3,0 ± 0,19 PU; PORH MAX-84,19 ± 19,46 PU; TH MAX 221,85 ± 91,57 PU; OR-43,68 ± 1,89%, VO2max-42,07 ± 3,63 ml/kg/min; control group: RF-15,58 ± 16,27 PU; BZ-2,81 ± 0,42 PU; PORH MAX-70,95 ± 24,48 PU; TH MAX 171,39 ± 32,18 PU; OR-42,36 ± 2,97%, VO2max- 35,14 ± 8,65 ml/kg/min;). The frequency analysis showed smaller oscillations of the sympathetic system and also in the cardiac frequency and increased activity of the endothelium in the cyclists. Conclusions: 1. Regular aerobic exercise has a beneficial impact on cutaneous microcirculation thus significantly improving the value of its parameters.2. Regular force training merely alters the values of the cutaneous microcirculation indexes. 3. The impact of physical activity on cutaneous microcirculation requires further studies.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of concurrent training on cardiopulmonary response, power and record level of middle distances (800m -1500m) foryoung athletics. Methods. Twenty-two young athletics were divided into three experimental groups: concurrent (n = 7), resistance (n = 8), and endurance (n = 7) training groups. Each group trained three times a week for eight weeks, with all types of training occurring in the same session. Parameters assessed were height, weight, power, strength, training age, maximal oxygen uptake, and training experience. All participants were fully informed about the aims of the study and gave their voluntary consent before participation. The measurement procedures were in agreement with ethical human experimentation. Subjects in the concurrent group participated for eight weeks, three days per week. First, the subjects completed 8-10 resistance-training exercises and then completed the hour of training by walking /jogging /running for up to 30 minutes on a treadmill at a prescribed target heart rate. A strand Treadmill Test was used to determine the maximal oxygen uptake, and dynamometer instruments were used to measure the strength of the leg and back. Results. The results revealed significant increases in: (1) Grip strength for the strength group versus the endurance group and for the concurrent group versus both the strength and endurance groups. (2) Maximal oxygen uptake for the endurance group versus both the strength and concurrent groups and for the concurrent group versus the strength group. (3) Leg strength for the strength group versus the endurance group and for the concurrent group versus the endurance group. (4) Back strength for the strength group versus the endurance group and the concurrent group versus the endurance group. Conclusion: In conclusion, the present study shows that eight weeks of concurrent strength and endurance training has beneficial effects on musculoskeletal power, maximal oxygen uptake and record level of 1500m track and field.

It is important to consider the effects that these different modalities have on running performance and injury risks. The purpose of this study was to compare movement quality, running economy (RE) and performance, injury-related biomechanical variables, and hip muscle strength before and after training with different cross-training modalities in high school runners. Thirty-one high school male runners trained for 4 weeks in 1 of 3 cross-training modalities, in addition to a running-only (n = 9) group, for which training sessions replaced 2 easy runs per week: cycling (CYCLE; n = 6), indoor elliptical (n = 7), and outdoor elliptical bike (EBIKE; n = 9). Functional movement screen (FMS), RE, 3,000-m performance, hip kinematics, and hip muscle strength were assessed. Paired t-tests and Cohen's d effect sizes were used to assess mean differences for each variable before and after training within each group. Elliptical bike training was the only modality that improved FMS scores (d = 1.36) and RE before and after training (d = 0.48). All groups showed improvements in 3,000-m performance, but large effects were found only for the CYCLE (d = 1.50) and EBIKE (d = 1.41) groups. Running-only (d = 1.25), CYCLE (d = 1.17), and EBIKE (d = 0.82) groups showed improvements in maximal hip extensor strength. Outdoor cycling and EBIKE cross-training may be the most effective cross-training modalities to incorporate in early season training to improve running performance in high school runners.

Twelve international and national level male rowers (21.25±1.76 years; height 188.3±4.92 cm; body mass 84.07±5.61 kg; training experience 7.38±2.70 years) took part in this investigation. The first group (n=6) performed low intensity strength endurance trainings using rowing ergometer for specific exercises (Specific group; S), and the second group (n=6) trained for strength endurance without rowing ergometer (Gym group; G). The experimental period lasted for four weeks. Stepwise incremental test was performed on the Concept II rowing ergometer (Morrisville, USA) before the first training week. After incremental ergometer test, subjects performed a constant 95% of Pa max test until exhaustion. This test was done 24 hours after incremental test and was performed before Week 1 and after Week 4. The stroke rates of the 95% Pa max test were not significantly different (p>0.05) between the two groups during both testing sessions. Despite the fact that both groups improved their 95% Pa max test results, no significant differences between the groups were found (p>0.05). However, test result was significantly improved only in G group (from 362±108 to 416.5±133 s), while no significant changes were observed in 95% Pa max test result in S group (from 372.8±132.3 to 442.3±153.1 s). No other significant differences were observed either between the two groups or between the two testing sessions (p>0.05). In conclusion, a 4 week non-specific strength endurance training program has an advantage over the specific strength endurance training on rowing ergometer in developing aerobic capacity in male rowers.

Moreover, no study has examined the training of perceptual-cognitive skills under physiological load. The current study comprised two phases. Firstly, we examined the impact of badminton-specific physiological load on anticipatory skills in expert badminton players (n = 13), including key underlying mechanisms, such as gaze behaviour. Under high physiological load, participants displayed less efficient visual search behaviour and showed a reduction in response accuracy. Secondly, we examined the effects of combining perceptual-cognitive simulation training with the high physiological load. Ten of the expert badminton players were assigned to a combined training group, where the simulation training and the physiological load intervention occurred simultaneously or an independent training group, whereby the two components were completed independently. The combined training group showed a positive change in the efficiency of their visual search behaviours compared to the independent training group, but no significant performance improvements were found. Overall, findings demonstrate that high physiological load is detrimental to experts' anticipatory skills. However, combining perceptual-cognitive simulation training with high physiological load can potentially negate these debilitating effects.

These include exercise economy, speed and power output at maximal oxygen uptake (vVO2max and wVO2max), the muscle power factor defined as maximal anaerobic velocity (vMART), time to exhaustion testing, as well as short-term and long-term endurance time trial performance. Both the cardiovascular system and the neuromuscular system can have an impact on these performance markers. Resistance training can improve neuromuscular efficiency, increase the ratio of fatigue resistant fast twitch IIA fibres and improve musculotendon stiffness in athletes. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to investigate the effect of strength training on performance indicators in highly trained endurance athletes. Numerous electronic databases were searched using Boolean cues and the key words strength training, resistance training, concurrent training, plyometrics, endurance athletes and performance to source appropriate articles. In total, 26 articles that investigated the effect of resistance training on performance in endurance athletes were included in this review. The results showed that resistance training was effective in improving endurance specific muscle power factors vVO2max, wVO2max and vMART. Gains in exercise economy, time trial performance, and time to exhaustion were also observed in elite level endurance athletes that undertook resistance training. Resistance training programs involving maximal strength or explosive loading, involving sport specific movements and completed a minimum of twice a week were shown to be the most beneficial. As such, the present available research justifies the use of resistance training as part of an elite endurance athlete's training program to enhance performance.

The aim was to describe strength performance changes during a heavy period of training where competing demands of conditioning and strength were trained in a relatively high volume. Fifteen professional AF players (mean ± SD: age 25.7 ± 2.8 years; height 187.7 ± 5.9 cm; body mass 86.2 ± 5.8 kg) from one AFL club, completed periodised strength, conditioning and skills training throughout an 11 week period of preseason. Descriptive statistics (mean and SD) were calculated for all variables. Effect Size (ES) was calculated, using Cohen's d statistic. 90% Confidence Interval (CI) were also calculated. Pearson's correlations coefficient was calculated between an isometric mid-thigh pulls (Newton per kilogram (N/kg)), weekly conditioning load (total weekly distance (kilometres)) and strength volume (repetitions). An average of 35 km and 1427 repetitions a week was covered over this period. A small increase in strength was shown (5 ± 0.78 N/kg), resulting in a small change (13 ± 0.05% increase, ES 0.69 ± 0.29) across the pre-season period. A very large negative correlation (r = -0.82) was shown between N/kg and weekly conditioning load, presenting the possible presence of an interference effect over this period.

Despite a number of studies examining the individual associations, only a few studies have examined the joint associations, and to our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the potential additive interaction of performing muscle strengthening activities and aerobic-based physical activity and their association with metabolic syndrome. Method: Using data from the 2003 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we computed three separate multivariable logistic regression models to examine the individual, combined, and additive interaction of meeting guidelines for accelerometer-assessed physical activity and self-reported muscle strengthening activities, and their association with metabolic syndrome. Results: We found that individuals meeting physical activity and muscle strengthening activity guidelines, respectively, were at 61 and 25 % lower odds of having metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, individuals meeting both guidelines had the lowest odds of having metabolic syndrome (70 %), in part due to the additive interaction of performing both modes of exercise. Conclusion: In this national sample, accelerometer-assessed physical activity and muscle strengthening activities were synergistically associated with metabolic syndrome.

"THE INFLUENCE OF A RESISTANCE TRAINING PROGRAM ON THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF PEOPLE WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY FROM MOTIVATION ROMANIA.","VIOREL, OPREA","Ovidius University Annals, Series Physical Education & Sport/Science, Movement & Health",="2285777X",,="20210902","21",,"410","6","157699696",,,"Article","RESISTANCE training; PHYSICAL training & conditioning; SPINAL cord injuries; WEIGHT training; CARPAL tunnel syndrome; STRENGTH training; ROMANIA",,"Aim. The physical performance and quality of life of wheelchair users are limited due to overuse injuries in the upper limb, being carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis of the rotator cuff and elbow muscles the more common injuries that occur in these types of people. Poor propulsion technique aggravates muscle pain, which can be corrected by adequate strengthening of the agonist and antagonist muscles. Weight training has been observed to improve upper limb strength in people with SCI. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of resistance resistance training with weights on maximum strength, endurance strength, and displacement speed in spinal cord-injured wheelchair users. Methods. Five wheelchair users participated voluntarily, the characteristics of which are illustrated in Table 1. The workouts were carried out three times a week for four weeks. The sessions lasted 50-60 min, during which time the strength exercises were performed. The testing session began with a standardized warm-up that consisted of 5 minutes of continuous propulsion displacement, shoulder elbow and wrist joint movements, pair resistance exercises, and progressions through the speed test space with accelerations. Subsequently, the following tests were performed in the order in which they are presented:displacement speed test, isometric maximal strength test, resistance force test. Results. Training produced significant increases in movement speed (18.6%, p <0.05). Strength improved 3.8%, but not significantly. Endurance strength, assessed by means of the fatigue index, improved 14.9% (p = 0.08). In data resulting from the mean values of the tests of all the subjects, before and after the four weeks of training, appear superimposed. Conclusions. The results found in these studies make us think that the duration of a training program with this type of disabled population should be longer, around 8-12 weeks of work if we really want to find significant improvements in strength. According to the results of the present study, strength training with loads between 40-70% of 1RM produces improvements in endurance strength but is not suitable for increasing maximal isometric strength. To achieve significant improvements in the maximum force values we would have to work with maximum or submaximal loads with more than 70-80% intensity, but it is not advisable according to the bibliography consulted, since it produces a high risk of injury to the shoulder joints and elbow. The result obtained with our participants in this study has a fatigue index of 14.9%, much lower than the results with healthy people. This great difference between the two may be due to the fact that wheelchair users have to constantly propel themselves with their arms, with which they have much more work on resistance than healthy people, with which the variation in force is less than compare the beginning with the end of the test. Resistance training through traditional musclebuilding exercises in spinal cord injuries is recommended, since it will improve performance in daily activities such as wheelchair propulsion. This type of work will have a favorable impact on the quality of life of these people. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=157699696&site=ehost-live"

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the influence of six months of physical endurance activity on the body composition and aerobic capacity of middle aged women. METHODS: Forty women between the ages of 40 to 55 years with a sedentary occupation and without regular physical activity took part in the study. The experimental group (n = 21) participated in dance aerobics lessons combined with strength training three times a week for 6 months, during exercise heart rate was monitored by heart rate monitors. The control group (n = 19) did not change their lifestyle during the observed period. All participants passed an all-out bicycle ergometer test to exhaustion and anthropometric measurement (bioelectrical impedance analysis method) before and after this six month program. RESULTS: In the experimental group, after finishing the intervention programme, positive changes were perceptible in almost all monitored parameters; specifically an increase of fat free mass in the lower limbs, peak oxygen consumption, and the duration of the exercise test was statistically signifi cant. Although, in the control group, some monitored parameters changed almost identically; the amount of fat free mass decreased and the duration of the exercise test diminished. Analysis of variance at repeated measurements confirmed that the intervention programme had a statistically significant and positive effect on the duration of the exercise test and on the amount of muscle and fat free mass in the right lower limb. CONCLUSIONS: Physical intervention had a statistically important positive influence on the amount of muscle and fat free mass in the right lower limb and on the duration of the exercise test (also logically signifi cant). The results were affected by the women's poor adherence to the aerobics programme, large differences in their motivation and the relatively low training intensity. Despite some inconsistent results, it can be said that an intervention programme in a style of aerobic dance combined with strengh training is suitable physical activity for increasing physical fitness in sedentary middle aged women.

Methods: Twenty moderately trained men aged 24.6 plus/minus 1.0 yr (mean plus/minus SE) were randomly assigned to either the SUP group (N = 10) or the UNSUP group (N = 8). Both groups performed identical linear periodized resistance training programs consisting of preparatory (10-12 repetitions maximum (RM), hypertrophy ( 8 to 10-RM), strength (5 to 8-RM), and peaking phases (3 to 6-RM) using free-weight and variable-resistance machine exercises. Subjects were tested for maximal squat and bench press strength (1-RM), squat jump power output, bench press muscular endurance, and body composition at week 0 and after 12 wk of training. Results: Mean training loads (kg per set) per week were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater in the SUP group than the UNSUP group at weeks 7 through 11 for the squat, and weeks 3 and 7 through 12 for the bench press exercises. The rates of increase (slope) of squat and bench press kg per set were significantly greater in the SUP group. Maximal squat and bench press strength were significantly greater at week 12 in the SUP group. Squat and bench press 1-RM, and mean and peak power output increased significantly after training in both groups. Relative local muscular endurance (80 % of 1-RM) was not compromised in either group despite significantly greater loads utilized in bench press muscular endurance testing after training. Body mass, fat mass, and fat-free mass increased significantly after training in the SUP group. Conclusion: Directly supervised, heavy-resistance training in moderately trained men resulted in a greater rate of training load increase and magnitude which resulted in greater maximal strength gains compared with unsupervised training.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-656746&site=ehost-live"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different exercise orders on the local muscular endurance of trained women. Methods. Nineteen women with a minimum of two years experience in resistance training volunteered to participate in the study (age 27.68 ± 5.24 years; body mass 60.31 ± 7.50 kg; height 161.83 ± 7.05 cm; body mass index 22.85 ± 1.85 kg. m2). Data were collected in two phases: 1) determining the one repetition maximum (1RM) for the bench press (1W), machine lat pull-down (LPD), free-weight shoulder press (SP), standing free-weight biceps curl (BC), and triceps extension (TE); 2) the completion of two resistance training sequences including 4 sets of exercise at 60% of 1 P.M with 2 minute rest intervals between sets with exercises performed until failure: Sequence A (SEQ A) comprised of: BP, LPI), SP, BC, TE while sequence B (SEQ B): TE, BC, SP, LPD, BP. Results. The mean number of repetitions per set in BP and TE presented significant reductions (p = 0.001 and p = 0.026, respectively) when they were the last exercise performed in each exercise sequence. Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was not significantly different between the exercise sequences; however, increases for BC (in SEQ A) and BP (in SEQ B) were observed when they were performed later in the sequences. Conclusion. These data indicate that in trained women, local muscular endurance is affected by exercise sequence, with exercises performed later in a workout sequence showing decreased exercise ability due to fatigue.

A secondary purpose was to determine whether training-induced changes in cytokines and CRP were influenced by age. Methods: Twenty-nine younger (18-35 yr) and 31 older (65-85 yr) subjects were assigned to young physically active (YPA, N 15; 25 +/- 5 yr), young physically inactive (YPI, N = 14; 25 +/- 4.7 yr), old physically active (OPA, N = 14; 71 +/- 4 yr), or old physically inactive (OPI, N = 17; 71 +/- 4 yr) groups. The inactive groups completed 12 wk (3 d.wk-1) of aerobic and resistance exercises, and the physically active control groups continued their normal exercise programs. Blood samples were collected before and after the 12-wk period, and the concentrations of serum CRP, plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-I beta) were determined using separate ELISA. Results: Control (YPA and OPA) estimated VO2max was unchanged. Exercise training increased estimated VO2max an average of 10.4% and increased strength by an average of 38.1% in both PI groups. Serum CRP decreased with training (YPI and OPI) groups and was not different from the YPA and OPA groups after training. Plasma IL-6 and IL-l beta did not change, whereas TNF-alpha was higher than YPI and YPA at baseline and after the intervention period. Conclusion: These results support the use of combined aerobic/resistance training as a modality to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease development as defined by a decrease in serum CRP concentration in healthy humans.

Angular velocities of movement were maintained at approximately 3.1 rad.s-1. following training, the VO2max was increased from 4.32 to 4.68 1.min-1. Maximal stroke volume was increased from 120 to 129 mL and heart rate response to an absolute submaximal exercise load was decreased from 153 to 146 beats.min-1. As well, enhanced removal of lactate from the blood was observed during recovery from exhausting exercise. No changes were observed for control subjects.

Twenty-seven trained males participated either as training or control subjects. The training group exercised for two 20 sec sets at each of six stations of hydraulic, variable resistance apparatus over two or three circuits maintaining an exercise: relief rtaio of 1:2 during each circuit. Subjects trained four times weekly over 5 weeks. The resistance at each station was adjusted as necessary to maintain consistent angular limb velocities of approximately 3.2 rad/sec. The VO2 max for the training group was increased by 9.5% when expressed in either absolute or relative terms. No changes were observed for control subjects. Oxygen consumption responses measured over two circuits for six training group subjects averaged 61 and 57% of VO2 max for exercise and relief intervals, respectively. It is therefore suggested that the hydraulic circuit resistance program described will elicit a metabolic intensity sufficient to improve aerobic power, even in previously trained subjects.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH219565&site=ehost-live"

Methods: Thirty-four children aged 6–11 years, with Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) levels I–III (I:8, II:15, III:11), participated in a 2-week program, combining an hour of modified constraint with 5 hr of bimanual practice daily. The Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) and the Jebsen–Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTTHF) were done pre-, post-, and 3-months post-intervention. Results: Mean AHA logits unit scores increased overtime (F2;50 = 5, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in AHA logits units change score between MACS levels (F4;56 = 1.4, p = 0.22). JTTHF scores did not change for either the affected or less-affected hand, although a significant interaction of time and MACS level was found in the less-affected side (F4;58 = 6.5, p < 0.01). Children in MACS levels I and II improved by similar degrees, in comparison to children at MACS level III who demonstrated significantly greater change over time. Conclusion: While a similar trend of improvement was found in the bimanual abilities of children at all MACS levels, only children at MACS level III had improved performance in unilateral abilities in the less-affected side following intervention.

The secondary purpose was to evaluate NT fitness training programs for evidence that they may provide beneficial options to help airmen improve their fitness scores. A search of the literature for 1980-2010 was performed using the Franzello Aeromedical Library, Public Medicine, and Air Force Institute of Technology search engines. There were 50 articles located and the authors selected 29 articles that specifi-cally addressed the primary and secondary purposes of this literature review. This review indicates that an NT training approach is warranted in the general Air Force population. Heavy leg strength training and agil-ity training show promise in enhancing aerobic fitness and improving fitness scores, particularly among members who have difficulty passing a physical fitness test. Most of the nontraditional forms of physical train-ing are not supported in the scientific literature, with the exception of heavy leg strength training and agility training. However, even these NT forms of training require further investigation. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=82394954&site=ehost-live"

Materials and methods: Fifteen handball players from a first league team took part in the study; their average height was 188.5 ± 4.7 cm; age 25.8±5.9; body mass 88.7± 11 kg; lean body mass - 76.4±6.2 kg; fat mass 12.4±5.8 kg. Two study sessions were held - in the initial phase of the preparation period for the following season and after a 6-week period of general endurance and strength training. The anaerobic fitness was assessed by a 30-second Wingate test. Results: Statistically significant differences were found between seven basic mechanical indices: Wtot =22.70±2.27 kJ (I session) and 23.25±1.86 kJ (II session); Wtot = 256.6±14.1 J/kg (I) and 262.5±16.9 J/kg (II); Pmax= 988.3±104.3 W (I) and 1012.0±79.1 W (II); Pmax=11.18±0.85 W/kg (I) and 11.44±0.78 W/kg (II); Tat=4.24±0.99 s (I) and 4.16±0.67 s (II); Tma= 2.78±0.81 s (I) and 3.10± 0.83 s (II); FI=25.0±4.6% (I) and 25.3±3.8% (II). Conclusions: A statistically significant improvement of the basic indices of anaerobic fitness following the 6-week training programme proved its effectiveness. The level of anaerobic power in the tested handball players was high. The relative values of maximum power and the amount of work performed by the players under test were similar to those measured in the senior and junior national team players.

Changes in the y-intercept following resistance training were negatively correlated with changes in the CP (r=-0.94, p less than 0.05, N=8). The present data show that the y-intercept of the CP function is sensitive to, and modified by, six weeks of resistance training. Given that resistance training had no significant influence on CP, TE at CP or VO2peak, the present study has also shown that six weeks of resistance training will not alter indices of endurance ability. The negative relationship between changes in the y-intercept and CP exposes a potential limitation of the linear CP function when evaluating changes in endurance ability following an intervention which significantly alters the y-intercept. The present study examined whether a six-week resistance training program would influence the critical power (CP) function, time to exhaustion (TE) at CP and/or peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). The CP function is believed to provide an index of endurance ability (CP given by the slope), and anaerobic work capacity (the y-intercept). Eight healthy, untrained males undertook lower-body resistance training (90 min/day, 3-4 times/wk) for six weeks; eight controls refrained from resistance or endurance training for the same period. Before and immediately following the training period, subjects completed three trials to determine their CP function, a test of VO2peak, a one-repetition maximum (1-RM) leg press test and TE at their CP.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPH419667&site=ehost-live"

Several studies showed the effectiveness of exercise on physical fitness and cardiovascular health; however, research on the long-term effects of different modes of exercise in subjects at risk is still lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare different modes of exercise on physical fitness and CVD risk factors in overweigh elderly men with high blood pressure. Methods Forty-eight overweigh elderly men (BMI≥25 kg/m2) with high blood pressure (SBP≥130 and/or DBP≥85 mmHg) were randomly assigned to an aerobic training group (ATG, n=15, 71.7±4.7 years), a combined aerobic and resistance training group (CTG, n=16, 68.5±3.5 years), and a control group (n=17, 67.0±5.8 years). Both training programs were of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, three days per week for nine months. Six independent physical fitness tests (back scratch, chair sit-and-reach, 30-s chair stand, arm curl, 8-foot up-and-go, 6-min walk), body fat mass, fat-free mass, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured on five different occasions. The data were analyzed using a mixed-model analysis of variance. Results ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of group (p ≥0.001) for all physical fitness tests, with significant differences between both training groups and control. However the ATG only improved flexibility (back scratch and chair sit-and-reach), whereas CTG improved all physical fitness components. ANOVA also identified a significant main effect of time for 8-foot up-and-go (p=0.031) in the CTG. A significant main effect of group (p=0.000) and time (p=0.029) was observed in body fat mass percentage, with a 2.3% decrease in CTG. A significant main effect of time was observed in SBP (p=0.005) with reductions of 15 mmHg and 24 mmHg (in ATG and CTG, respectively) and in DBP (p=0.011) with reductions of 6 mmHg and 12 mm Hg (in ATG and CTG, respectively). Conclusions Both training programs increased physical fitness, however the effects are more extensive with the combination of aerobic and resistance training. exercise training is a non-pharmacological safe and effective tool in reducing blood pressure, but larger changes are observed in the presence of body fat loss. Therefore, the combination of aerobic training with resistance training in the same program is more effective in the promotion of physical fitness and in the prevention of CVD risk factors than aerobic training alone.

The goal of exercise-based interventions is an improvement in functional performance. However, improvements are often determined by ""statistically significant"" changes. We investigated the ""minimum clinically important difference,"" ""the smallest change that is important to the patient,"" for commonly reported physical function tests. Design: Nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients completed 12-wks of a combined aerobic (plus resistance training). The incremental shuttle walking test, sit-to-stand 5 and 60, estimated 1-repetitionmaximum for the knee extensors, and VO2peak were assessed. After the intervention, patients rated their perceived change in health. Both anchor- and distribution-based minimum clinically important difference approaches were calculated. Results: The minimum clinically important differencewas calculated as follows: incremental shuttlewalking test, +45 m; sit-to-stand 5, -4.2 secs; VO2peak, +1.5 ml/kg per min. Because of comparable increases in ""anchor"" groups, no minimum clinically important difference was estimated for the sit-to-stand 60 or estimated 1-repetition maximum. Conclusions: We have established the minimum clinically important difference in chronic kidney disease for common tests of physical function. These values represent the minimumchange required for patients to perceive noticeable and beneficial change to their health. These scores will help interpret changes after exercise interventions where these tests are used. These minimum clinically important differences can be used to power future studies to detect clinically important changes.

Various training methods have been suggested to improve muscular power and dynamic athletic performance. Although various acute training valuables (e.g., sets, repetitions, rest intervals) could be manipulated, the training loads used are some of the most important factors that determine the training stimuli and the consequent training adaptations. Many research results showed that the use of different training loads elicits the different training adaptations and further indicated the load- and velocity-specific adaptations in muscular-power development. Using the optimal loads at which mechanical power output occurs has been recommended, especially to enhance maximum muscular power. Additionally, introducing periodization and combined training approach into resistance-training programs may further facilitate muscular-power development and enhance a wide variety of athletic performances.

Methods: Physically active men were matched to an order sequence of endurance followed by strength (E + S, n = 12) or strength followed by endurance (S + E, n = 17). The subjects performed one experimental loading consisting of steady-state cycling and a leg press protocol before and after 24 weeks of order-specific combined training. Results: No between-group difference in acute reductions of force was observed at week 0 (E + S −23 %, p < 0.001; S + E −22 %, p < 0.01) and 24 (E + S −25 %, p < 0.001; S + E −27 %, p < 0.001) and recovery in force was completed after 24 h in both groups at week 0 and 24.

Conclusions: This study showed an order effect (E + S vs. S + E) in concentrations of testosterone during 2 days of recovery at week 0, which was diminished after 24 weeks of training. The initial difference in testosterone concentrations during recovery did not seem to be associated with strength development.

"The Order of Concurrent Training Does not Affect Soccer-Related Performance Adaptations.","McGawley, K.; Andersson, P.-I.","International Journal of Sports Medicine",="01724622",,="20131101","34","11","983","8","91936965",,,"Article","PHYSICAL training & conditioning; PHYSIOLOGICAL adaptation; ATHLETIC ability; RUNNING; SOCCER; SWEDEN; ANALYSIS of covariance; CONFIDENCE intervals; T-test (Statistics); DATA analysis software; DESCRIPTIVE statistics",,"Despite the wealth of evidence regarding physical training strategies in soccer, there is little information regarding soccer-specific concurrent training and the effects of training order. The current study aimed to: i) quantify the effects of concurrent high-intensity run-based training (HIT) and strength- and power-based training (STR) on soccer-specific performance, and ii) investigate the order effect of completing HIT and STR either first or second within training sessions. Eighteen semi- and fully-professional players completed a battery of field- and gym-based tests before and after a 5-week preseason training intervention. Players were pair-matched and completed 3 sessions per week of HIT followed by STR (n = 9) or STR followed by HIT (n = 9). ANCOVA tests revealed no differences between groups for changes in any of the measures ( p > 0.05). However, a training effect was observed for all measures ( p < 0.05), with 10-m sprint, 6 × 30-m repeated sprint, 40-m agility and Yo-Yo test performances improving by 1.8 ± 2.6%, 1.3 ± 1.8%, 1.0 ± 1.5 % and 19.4 ± 23.4%, respectively (n = 18). In conclusion, there was a positive effect of the concurrent training approach on key measures of soccer performance, but the order of completing HIT and STR appears inconsequential to performance adaptations.

Methods: Immediately before the start of the competition season, all skiers performed three 5-min submaximal stages of roller skiing on a treadmill for measurement of oxygen cost, as well as a 3-min self-paced performance test using both the double poling (DP) and diagonal stride (DIA) techniques. During the 3-min performance tests, the total distance covered, peak oxygen uptake (...O2peak), and accumulated oxygen deficit were determined. Each skier documented the intensity and mode of their training during the preceding 6 months in a diary. Results: There were no differences between the groups with respect to oxygen cost or gross efficiency at the submaximal speeds. The WC skiers covered 6%-7% longer distances during the 3-min tests and exhibited average ...O2peak values of ~70 and ~65 mL⋅min-1⋅kg-1 with DIA and DP, respectively, which were 10% and 7% higher than the NC skiers (all P < 0.05). However, the accumulated oxygen deficit did not differ between groups. From May to October, the WC skiers trained a total of 532 ± 73 h (270 ± 26 sessions) versus 411 ± 62 h (240 ± 27 sessions) for the NC skiers. In addition, the WC skiers performed 26% more low-intensity and almost twice as much moderate-intensity endurance and speed training (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of a high oxygen uptake and the ability to use this while performing the different skiing techniques on varying terrains for female cross-country skiers to win international races. In addition, the training data documented here provide benchmark values for female endurance athletes aiming for medals.

Based on predetermined eligibility criteria, chronic effect trials, comparing strength-endurance (SE) with endurance-strength (ES) training sequence in the same session were included. Data on effect sizes, sample size and SD as well other related study characteristics were extracted. The effect sizes were pooled using, Fixed or Random effect models as per level of heterogeneity between studies and a further sensitivity analyses was carried out using Inverse Variance Heterogeneity (IVHet) models to adjust for potential bias due to heterogeneity. Lower body 1RM was significantly higher when strength training preceded endurance with a pooled mean change of 3.96 kg (95%CI: 0.81 to 7.10 kg). However, the training sequence had no impact on aerobic capacity with a pooled mean difference of 0.39 ml.kg.min-1 (95%CI: -1.03 to 1.81 ml.kg.min-1). Sequencing strength training prior to endurance in concurrent training appears to be beneficial for lower body strength adaptations, while the improvement of aerobic capacity is not affected by training order.

Twenty-six junior basketball players were randomly divided into a control and a combined training group. The combined training group performed a combined training programme consisting of 5 sets at 5–8 RM (Repetition Maximum) half-squats with sprints performed between each set. Post-activation potentiation was considered as the increase in sprint velocity in trials executed between and after the resistance sets compared with the sprint trial performed before the resistance sets of the respective first and last training session. For sprint evaluation the running distances 0–10 and 0–30 m were selected. The intervention increased both strength and sprint performance. No post-activation potentiation effect was observed during the first training session in either group. Post-activation potentiation appeared in the combined training group during the last training session of the intervention in both 0–10 and 0–30 m sprint. This study illustrates that post-activation potentiation effect on sprint performance in junior basketball players, who did not previously follow systematic resistance training, emerges after a 10-week resistance/sprint combined training programme.

The purpose of this investigation was to establish any associations between aerobic and anaerobic performance. Eleven participants (n = 11, age = 34.1 ± 13 years, VO2max = 58.4 ± 7.8) volunteered for this study. Participants were asked for endurance training experience (4.7 ± 3.7 years) and resistance training experience (4.1 ± 4.6 years). To meet training status, participants were to have a VO2max in the 80th percentile as per ACSM guidelines. The Bruce treadmill test was used to measure aerobic performance. In order to measure anaerobic performance, several tests were completed utilizing a force platform. A Pearson Product R Correlation Coefficient was calculated to determine correlations between variables. The results show significant correlation between VO2max and RFD (r = 0.68). Further analyses utilizing Cohen's effect size indicated a strong association between VO2max and peak force, as well as running efficiency and peak power, relative peak power, and power endurance. These results indicate an existing possibility that anaerobic performance measures such as RFD may have a positive relationship with aerobic performance measures such as VO2max. Therefore, it may be beneficial to integrate specific training components which focus on improving RFD as a method of improving running performance.

Despite the growing popularity of high-intensity cross-training (HICT), little is currently known about the effects of this mixed modality exercise stimulus on arterial stiffness. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the arterial stiffness of habitual HICT participants vs. aerobically active and sedentary controls using a cross-sectional design. A total of 30 participants were recruited: 10 middle-aged long-term participants of HICT (CrossFit) and 20 age, sex, and height matched controls (10 recreationally active, 10 sedentary). Central and peripheral pulse wave velocities were measured for the carotid-femoral and femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial segments. Aerobic fitness (maximal oxygen uptake, VO 2max) was measured and typical exercise participation rates were self-reported for each group. HICT participants manifested central pulse wave velocity (PWV) (5.3 ± 1.0 m/s, mean ± SD) and VO 2max (43 ± 6 mL/kg/min) values nearly identical to active controls. Both active groups had significantly better values than sedentary controls (7.1 ± 1.0 m/s, p ≤ 0.001; and 32 ± 7 mL/kg/min, p = 0.01). No differences were observed in peripheral PWV between groups. Habitual participation in HICT exercise was not associated with increased central nor peripheral arterial stiffness. Long-term HICT participants presented with similar fitness and arterial stiffness as compared with participants who practiced traditional aerobic exercise. Compared to sedentary living, HICT may offer musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health benefits without negatively impacting arterial stiffness.

Concurrent training requires the athlete to perform both resistance and endurance exercise within a training plan. This training paradigm has been associated with an 'interference effect', with attenuated strength adaptation in comparison to that following isolated resistance training. The effectiveness of the training programme rests on the intricacies of manipulating acute training variables, such as exercise sequence. The research, in the most part, does not provide a clarity of message as to whether intra-session exercise sequence has the potential to exacerbate or mitigate the interference effect associated with concurrent training methods. Objective: The aim of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether intra-session concurrent exercise sequence modifies strength-based outcomes associated with the interference effect. Methods: Ten studies were identified from a systematic review of the literature for the outcomes of lower-body dynamic and static strength, lower-body hypertrophy, maximal aerobic capacity and body fat percentage. Each study examined the effect of intra-session exercise sequence on the specified outcomes, across a prolonged (≥5 weeks) concurrent training programme in healthy adults. Results: Analysis of pooled data indicated that resistance-endurance exercise sequence had a positive effect for lower-body dynamic strength, in comparison to the alternate sequence (weighted mean difference, 6.91% change; 95% confidence interval 1.96, 11.87 change; p = 0.006), with no effect of exercise sequence for lower-body muscle hypertrophy (weighted mean difference, 1.15% change; 95% confidence interval −1.56, 3.87 change; p = 0.40), lower-body static strength (weighted mean difference, −0.04% change; 95% confidence interval −3.19, 3.11 change; p = 0.98), or the remaining outcomes of maximal aerobic capacity and body fat percentage ( p > 0.05). Conclusion: These results indicate that the practice of concurrent training with a resistance followed by an endurance exercise order is beneficial for the outcome of lower-body dynamic strength, while alternating the order of stimuli offers no benefit for training outcomes associated with the interference effect.

Thirty-three untrained adolescents of both sexes (males, n = 17; females, n = 16; 14 ± 1 years) were randomly assigned into either ( i) HL ( n = 17): performing 3 sets of 4-6 repetitions to momentary concentric failure; or ( ii) LL ( n = 16): performing 2 sets of 12-15 repetitions to momentary concentric failure. RT was performed for 2×/week for 9 weeks. Change in maximum strength (1 repetition maximum) and absolute muscular endurance for barbell bench press was assessed. Weekly volume-load was calculated as sets ( n) × repetitions ( n) × load (kg). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) revealed that both groups significantly increased in strength and absolute endurance with large effect sizes ( d = 1.51-1.66). There were no between-group differences for change in strength or absolute endurance. Ninety-five percent CIs revealed that both groups significantly increased in weekly volume-load with large effect sizes (HL = 1.66, LL = 1.02). There were no between-group differences for change in volume-load though average weekly volume-load was significantly greater for LL ( p < 0.001). Significant Pearson's correlations were found for the HL group between average weekly volume-load and both strength ( r = 0.650, p = 0.005) and absolute endurance ( r = 0.552, p = 0.022) increases. Strength and absolute endurance increases do not differ between HL and LL conditions in adolescents when performed to momentary concentric failure. Under HL conditions greater weekly volume-load is associated with greater strength and absolute endurance increases.

Furthermore, based upon the limited evidence available, this paper aims to provide practical training suggestions by which to develop competitive handcycling performance. Handbike configuration, individual physiological characteristics, and training history all play a significant role in determining competitive handcycling performance. Optimal handcycling technique is highly dependent upon handbike configuration. As such, seat positioning, crank height, crank fore-aft position, crank length, and handgrip position must all be individually configured. In regard to physiological determinants, power output at a fixed blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol·L−1, relative oxygen consumption, peak aerobic power output, relative upper body strength, and maximal anaerobic power output have all been demonstrated to impact upon handcycling performance capabilities. Therefore, it is suggested that that an emphasis be placed upon the development and frequent monitoring of these parameters. Finally, linked to handcycling training, it is suggested that handcyclists should consider adopting a concurrent strength and endurance training approach, based upon a block periodization model that employs a mixture of endurance, threshold, interval, and strength training sessions. Despite our findings, it is clear that several gaps in our scientific knowledge of handcycling remain and that further research is necessary in order to improve our understanding of factors that determine optimal performance of competitive handcyclists. Finally, further longitudinal research is required across all classifications to study the effects of different training programs upon handcycling performance.

Assessment of the physiological determinants of performance is an integral part of sports science support for elite athletes. Laboratory and field-based physiological assessments are fundamental elements in profiling athletes, assessing training adaptations, and interrogating programme efficacy. The relatively small and highly specific adaptations associated with high-performance training call for valid, reliable, and sensitive methods of assessment. Recent advances in the physiological assessment of athletes have led to the development of a plethora of laboratory and field-based procedures. In the assessment of the athlete, there is a tension between the high reliability and low ecological validity of laboratory assessments and the low reliability and high validity of field-based methods. In an attempt to enhance ecological validity of training and physiological assessment, various sports-specific ergometers have been designed. This development has helped to match fitness assessment procedures to the demands of the sport concerned.

These include body composition, pulmonary function, cardiorespiratory efficiency, muscular strength and endurance, and anaerobic power. SCI athletes are less fat and have a larger lean body mass than nonathletes, and male SCI are less fat than female SCI. Static lung volumes are usually below normal values in SCI subjects, but athletic SCI subjects tend to have higher values than sedentary SCI. Sedentary SCI subjects have lower aerobic power (VO2max) than the general able-bodied (AB) sedentary population on tests of arm cranking or wheelchair ergometry. Low-lesion paraplegics generally achieve VO2max values comparable to AB subjects. VO2max is inversely related to level of injury, that is, the higher the SCI, the lower the VO2max. However, elite SCI athletes are capable of achieving very high levels of VO2max during arm exercise. SCI subjects respond well to strength and muscular endurance training. Paraplegic subjects achieve higher anaerobic power scores than quadriplegic subjects. Increases in VO2max occur at about the same magnitude as in AB subjects. The required intensity level appears to be about 70-80% of maximal heart rate reserve. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=20730253&site=ehost-live"

Inclusion criteria included: at least one outcome measure addressing a cardiovascular, endocrinological, systemic or proximal musculoskeletal, or psychosocial outcome, use of clinically available blood flow restriction equipment, use of either resistance or aerobic training in combination with BFR, and use of quantitative measures. Exclusion criteria for articles included only measuring local or distal musculoskeletal changes due to BFR training, examining only passive BFR or ischemic preconditioning, articles not originating from a scholarly peer-reviewed journal, CEBM level of evidence less than two, or PEDro score less than four. Articles included in this review were analyzed with the CEBM levels of evidence hierarchy and PEDro scale. Results Thirty-five articles were included in the review. PEDro scores ranged between 4 and 8, and had CEBM levels of evidence of 1 and 2. Common systems studied included cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and psychosocial. This review found positive or neutral effects of blood flow restriction training on cardiovascular, endocrinological, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial outcomes. Conclusions Although BFR prescription parameters and exercise interventions varied, the majority of included articles reported BFR training to produce favorable or non-detrimental effects to the cardiovascular, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems. This review also found mixed effects on psychosocial outcomes when using BFR. Additionally, this review found no detrimental outcomes directly attributed to blood flow restriction training on the test subjects or outcomes tested. Thus, BFR training may be an effective intervention for patient populations that are unable to perform traditional exercise training with positive effects other than traditional distal muscle hypertrophy and strength and without significant drawbacks to the individual.

Conducting explosive training, with an emphasis on movements which mimic the mechanics of running, also upgrades your maximal running velocity. Now, there is a third way to get faster: new research carried out in Norway reveals that high-resistance strength training improves speed, economy, and endurance performance. Although this seems improbable at first glance, since the rates of movement utilized during maximal strength training are slow, the improvements in muscle function and competitive ability are huge. In this article, we show you exactly how to use high-resistance training to make yourself a faster runner.

Despite this, no research has identified the most effective training methods for enhancing medium- to long-distance sprint outcomes. Objectives: This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to (1) analyse the ability of different methods to enhance medium- to long-distance sprint performance outcomes (0–30 m, 0 to > 30 m, and the maximum sprinting velocity phase [Vmax]) within football code athletes and (2) identify how moderator variables (i.e., football code, sex, age, playing standard, phase of season) affected the training response. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases and performed a random-effects meta-analysis (within-group changes and pairwise between-group differences) to establish standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals and 95% prediction intervals. This identified the magnitude and direction of the individual training effects of intervention subgroups (sport only; primary, secondary, tertiary, and combined training methods) on medium- to long-distance sprint performance while considering moderator variables. Results: In total, 60 studies met the inclusion criteria (26 with a sport-only control group), totalling 111 intervention groups and 1500 athletes. The within-group changes design reported significant performance improvements (small–moderate) between pre- and post-training for the combined, secondary (0–30 and 0 to > 30 m), and tertiary training methods (0–30 m). A significant moderate improvement was found in the Vmax phase performance only for tertiary training methods, with no significant effect found for sport only or primary training methods. The pairwise between-group differences design (experimental vs. control) reported favourable performance improvements (large SMD) for the combined (0 to > 30 m), primary (Vmax phase), secondary (0–30 m), and tertiary methods (all outcomes) when compared with the sport-only control groups. Subgroup analysis showed that the significant differences between the meta-analysis designs consistently demonstrated a larger effect in the pairwise between-group differences than the within-group change. No individual training mode was found to be the most effective. Subgroup analysis identified that football code, age, and phase of season moderated the overall magnitude of training effects. Conclusions: This review provides the first systematic review and meta-analysis of all sprint performance development methods exclusively in football code athletes. Secondary, tertiary, and combined training methods appeared to improve medium-long sprint performance of football code athletes. Tertiary training methods should be implemented to enhance Vmax phase performance. Nether sport-only nor primary training methods appeared to enhance medium to long sprint performance. Performance changes may be attributed to either adaptations specific to the acceleration or Vmax phases, or both, but not exclusively Vmax. Regardless of the population characteristics, sprint performance can be enhanced by increasing either the magnitude or the orientation of force an athlete can generate in the sprinting action, or both.

Therefore, developing an evidence base for understanding training methods to enhance short-sprint performance is key for practitioners. However, current systematic reviews are limited by (1) a lack of focus on football code athletes, (2) a lack of consideration of all training modalities and (3) a failure to account for the normal training practices undertaken by intervention groups within their analysis. Therefore, this review aimed to (1) conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature evaluating training interventions upon short-sprint performance within football code athletes, (2) undertake a meta-analysis to assess the magnitude of change of sport-sprint performance following training interventions and (3) identify how moderator variables affect the training response. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to establish standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. This identified the magnitude and direction of the individual training effects of intervention subgroups (primary, secondary, combined-specific, tertiary and combined training methods) on short-sprint performance while considering moderator variables (i.e., football code, sex, age, playing standard, phase of season). Results: 121 studies met the inclusion criteria, totalling 3419 athletes. Significant improvements (small-large) were found between pre- and post-training in short-sprint performance for the combined, secondary, tertiary and combined-specific training methods. No significant effect was found for primary or sport only training. No individual mode was found to be the most effective. Between-subgroup analysis identified that football code, age, playing standard and phase of season all moderated the overall magnitude of training effects. Conclusions: This review provides the largest systematic review and meta-analysis of short-sprint performance development methods and the only one to assess football code athletes exclusively. Practitioners can apply combined, secondary and tertiary training methods to improve short-sprint performance within football code athletes. The application of sport only and primary methods does not appear to improve short-sprint performance. Regardless of the population characteristics, short-sprint performance can be enhanced by increasing either or both the magnitude and the orientation of force an athlete can generate in the sprinting action.

With the benefit of more data, our understanding of the training-performance puzzle has improved. What were we thinking 20 years ago, and how has our thinking changed over time? Although early investigators attributed overuse injuries to excessive training loads, it has become clear that rapid spikes in training load, above what an athlete is accustomed, explain (at least in part) a large proportion of injuries. In this respect, it appears that overuse injuries may arise from athletes being underprepared for the load they are about to perform. However, a question of interest to both athletic trainers (ATs) and researchers is why some athletes sustain injury at low training loads, while others can tolerate much greater training loads? A higher chronic training load and well-developed aerobic fitness and lower body strength appear to moderate the training-injury relationship and provide a protective effect against spikes in load. The training-performance puzzle is complex and dynamic--at any given time, multiple inputs to injury and performance exist. The challenge facing researchers is obtaining large enough longitudinal data sets to capture the time-varying nature of physiological and musculoskeletal capacities and training-load data to adequately inform injury-prevention efforts. The trainingperformance puzzle can be solved, but it will take collaboration between researchers and clinicians as well as an understanding that efficacy (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in an idealized or controlled setting) does not equate to effectiveness (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in the real-world setting, where many variables cannot be controlled).

Ten healthy men completed a single session of combined (aerobic and resistance) and aerobic only training, in a randomized order. Surface electromyographic activity and torque obtained during maximal voluntary and electrically evoked contractions of the knee extensor muscles were analyzed to distinguish peripheral from central adaptations. The isometric torque developed by the knee extensor muscles during maximal voluntary contraction decreased significantly following a single session of both combined (-9.2%, p=0.043) and aerobic(-9.6%, p =0.005) training. This was accompanied by a decrease in central activation of the knee extensor muscles after each training session (respectively 2.9, p=0.005 and 1.8% p=0.040) as indicated by twitch interpolation technique. After the combined training protocol, the peak torque of the twitch significantly increased by 6.8% (p=0.046), whereas it decreased by 17.3% (p=0.016) after the aerobic training protocol. The present study demonstrates that the decrease in torque production is similar after a single combined training session or after an aerobic training session of the same duration. Both central and peripheral mechanisms could explain the decrease of torque. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=50742433&site=ehost-live"

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the effect of 3 months of resistance and aerobic training programs on postural responses to unexpected perturbations under stable and unstable conditions in the overweight and obese. METHODS: A group of 17 overweight and obese subjects, divided into two groups, underwent either resistance or aerobic training for a period of 3 months (3 sessions per week). Prior to and after completing the training, they performed the load release balance test while standing on either a stable or unstable surface, with eyes open and closed. RESULTS: Peak posterior center of pressure (CoP) displacement, and the time to peak posterior CoP displacement during a bipedal stance on a foam surface with eyes open (17.3%, p = 0.019 and 15.4%, p = 0.029) and eyes closed (15.0%, p = 0.027 and 13.2%, p = 0.034), decreased significantly. In addition, the total anterior to posterior CoP displacement, and the time from peak anterior to peak posterior CoP displacement, both with eyes open (18.1%, p = 0.017 and 12.2%, p = 0.040) and eyes closed (16.3%, p = 0.023 and 11.7%, p = 0.044), also significantly decreased. However, after completing the resistance training, the parameters registered while standing on a stable platform, both with eyes open and closed, did not change significantly. The group that underwent an aerobic training also failed to show any significant changes in parameters of the load release balance test. CONCLUSION: Three months of resistance training in overweight and obese subjects improves reactive balance control in response to unexpected perturbations under unstable conditions, both with and without visual cues. Due to the fact that this unstable load release balance test was found to be sensitive in revealing post-training changes, it would be suitable for implementing in the functional diagnostic for this group, in addition to complementing existing testing methods.

The sample was made up of 30 young amateur players (age, Mean ± standard deviation [SD] = 16 ± 0.74 years old) randomly divided into three 3 groups of 10. Each group performed a different resistance training methodology for 3 months: group 1 performed intermittent training, group 2 interval training and group 3 steady state training. The parameters taken into consideration were BMI and VO2max, obtained from Gacon test. Paired Sample T Test was performed to check the difference between pre and post 12 training weeks of each group regarding VO2max and BMI. A 3x2 mixed ANOVA was used to test for differences in training programs induced changes in maximal strength and functional capacity variables. The independent variables included one between-subjects factor (training intervention) with three levels (IT, HIIT, and SST), and one within-subject factor (time) with two levels (pre- and post-intervention). A significant difference (p<0.05) between pre and post all of the three training protocols on VO2max was found, but no significant interaction (p>0.05) between group and time. BMI had no significant improvement (p>0.05). Intermittent, interval and endurance training all were equally effective improving VO2max, but not BMI.

Blood flow restriction (BFR) training is a promising alternative to conventional therapy approaches during musculoskeletal rehabilitation because various studies support its beneficial effects on muscle mass, strength, aerobic capacity, and pain perception. In this perspective article, we used an evidence-based progressive model of a rehabilitative program that integrated BFR in 4 rehabilitation phases: (1) passive BFR, (2) BFR combined with aerobic training, (3) BFR combined with low-load resistance training, and (4) BFR combined with low-load resistance training and traditional high-load resistance training. Considering the current research, we propose that a BFR-assisted rehabilitation has the potential to shorten the time course of therapy to reach the stage where the patient is able to tolerate resistance training with high loads. The information and arguments presented are intended to stimulate future research, which compares the time to achieve rehabilitative milestones and their physiological bases in each stage of the musculoskeletal rehabilitation process. This requires the quantification of BFR training-induced adaptations (eg, muscle mass, strength, capillary-to-muscle-area ratio, hypoalgesia, molecular changes) and the associated changes in performance with a high measurement frequency (≤1 week) to test our hypothesis. This information will help to quantify the time saved by BFR-assisted musculoskeletal rehabilitation. This is of particular importance for patients, because the potentially accelerated recovery of physical functioning would allow them to return to their work and/or social life earlier. Furthermore, other stakeholders in the health care system (eg, physicians, nurses, physical therapists, insurance companies) might benefit from that with regard to work and financial burden.

The musculature of the lower extremities is especially important in this context since rapid and forceful movements with the weight of the body are performed repeatedly throughout a match. In the present study, we examined various leg-strength parameters of 35 male elite badminton players who had been performing resistance exercises as part of their physical training for several years. The badminton players were compared with an age-matched reference group, the members of whom were physically active on a recreational basis, and to the same reference group after they had performed resistance training for 14 weeks. Maximal muscle strength of the knee extensor (quadriceps) and flexor muscles (hamstrings) was determined using isokinetic dynamometry. To measure explosive muscle strength, the contractile rate of force development was determined during maximal isometric muscle contractions. In general, the badminton players showed greater maximal muscle strength and contractile rate of force development than the reference group: mean quadriceps peak torque during slow concentric contraction: 3.69 Nm · kg-1, s=0.08 vs. 3.26 Nm · kg-1, s=0.8 (P<0.001); mean hamstring peak torque during slow concentric contraction: 1.86 Nm · kg-1, s=0.04 vs. 1.63 Nm · kg-1, s=0.04 (P<0.001); mean quadriceps rate of force development at 100 ms: 24.4 Nm · s-1·kg-1, s=0.5 vs. 22.1 Nm·s-1 · kg-1, s=0.6 (P<0.05); mean hamstring rate of force development at 100 ms: 11.4 Nm · s-1·kg-1, s=0.3 vs. 8.9 Nm · s-1 · kg-1, s=0.4 (P<0.05). However, after 14 weeks of resistance training the reference group achieved similar isometric and slow concentric muscle strength as the badminton players, although the badminton players still had a higher isometric rate of force development and muscle strength during fast (240° · s-1) quadriceps contractions. Large volumes of concurrent endurance training could have attenuated the long-term development of maximal muscle strength in the badminton players. The badminton players had a higher contractile rate of force development than the reference group before and after resistance training. Greater explosive muscle strength in the badminton players might be a physiological adaptation to their badminton training.

The large number of training sessions and overall volume undertaken by triathletes to improve fitness and performance can also increase the risk of injury, illness, or excessive fatigue. Short- and medium-term individualized training plans, periodization strategies, and work/rest balance are necessary to minimize interruptions to training due to injury, illness, or maladaptation. Even in the absence of health and wellbeing concerns, it is unclear whether cellular signals triggered by multiple training stimuli that drive training adaptations each day interfere with each other. Distribution of training intensity within and between different sessions is an important aspect of training. Both internal (perceived stress) and external loads (objective metrics) should be considered when monitoring training load. Incorporating strength training to complement the large body of endurance work in triathlon can help avoid overuse injuries. We explore emerging trends and strategies from the latest literature and evidence-based knowledge for improving training readiness and performance during competition in triathlon.

"Training and game loads and injury risk in elite Australian footballers.","Rogalski, Brent; Dawson, Brian; Heasman, Jarryd; Gabbett, Tim J.","Journal of Science & Medicine in Sport",="14402440",,="20131101","16","6","499","5","91268556",,,"Article","FOOTBALL injuries; GAMES; COHORT analysis; INJURY risk factors; AUSTRALIA; REFERENCE groups; LONGITUDINAL method; LOGISTIC regression analysis",,"Abstract: Objectives: To examine the relationship between combined training and game loads and injury risk in elite Australian footballers. Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Forty-six elite Australian footballers (mean±SD age of 22.2±2.9 y) from one club were involved in a one-season study. Training and game loads (session-RPE multiplied by duration in min) and injuries were recorded each time an athlete exerted an exercise load. Rolling weekly sums and week-to-week changes in load were then modelled against injury data using a logistic regression model. Odds ratios (OR) were reported against a reference group of the lowest training load range. Results: Larger 1 weekly (>1750AU, OR=2.44–3.38), 2 weekly (>4000AU, OR=4.74) and previous to current week changes in load (>1250AU, OR=2.58) significantly related (p <0.05) to a larger injury risk throughout the in-season phase. Players with 2–3 and 4–6 years of experience had a significantly lower injury risk compared to 7+ years players (OR=0.22, OR=0.28) when the previous to current week change in load was more than 1000AU. No significant relationships were found between all derived load values and injury risk during the pre-season phase. Conclusions: In-season, as the amount of 1–2 weekly load or previous to current week increment in load increases, so does the risk of injury in elite Australian footballers. To reduce the risk of injury, derived training and game load values of weekly loads and previous week-to-week load changes should be individually monitored in elite Australian footballers.

For this study, the Golden Generation was defined by FAF as footballers who had played at least ten official World cup or European championship qualifying games between the years 1996-2008 and played in international top leagues during their career. Data were collected anonymously by an online survey. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the mean values of childhood and adolescent training hours and motivation types. The normality of the data distribution was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences between the player groups in practice hours in childhood and adolescence were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and the significance level for pairwise comparisons was adjusted by Bonferroni correction. Interrelations between the players' motivation types were analyzed with Spearman's correlational coefficients. The results showed that the players had specialized in football at around age 11. Most (81%) had also practiced another sport. Football practice hours, which increased throughout childhood and adolescence, were higher than combined training for other sports. The Golden Generation players spent the least time on organized practice and the most on unorganized training and other sports in the early years. The elite footballers scored highest in intrinsic motivation and lowest in amotivation towards football. Intrinsic motivation and the two forms of autonomous extrinsic motivation were positively intercorrelated. Amotivation was negatively associated with intrinsic motivation and positively with external regulation.

The average oxygen uptake for international soccer teams ranges from 55 to 68?ml?·?kg -1 ?·?min -1 and the half-squat maximal strength from 120 to 180?kg. These values are similar to those found in other team sports. Recently, it has been shown that the heart's stroke volume is the element in the oxygen chain that mainly limits aerobic endurance for athletes. These findings have given rise to more intensive training interventions to secure high stroke volumes, which, in turn, have proved positive in changing both maximal oxygen consumption and soccer performance in terms of distance covered, contacts with the ball and number of sprints in a game. The training employed has consisted of 4 × 4-min “intervals” running uphill at 90?–?95% of maximal heart rate interspersed with 3?min jogging at 70% of maximal heart rate to facilitate removal of lactate. Research has revealed that a soccer-specific training routine with the ball might be as effective as plain running. Strength training to produce neural adaptations has been effective in changing not only strength in terms of “one-repetition maximum”, but also sprinting velocity and jumping height, in elite soccer players without any change in body mass. The same training has also improved running economy and thus aerobic endurance performance. The training regimen used for a European Champions League team was 4 × 4 repetitions of half-squats with the emphasis on maximal mobilization of force in the concentric action.

There is a growing body of research indicating that typical resistance exercises impair neuromuscular function and endurance performance during periods of resistance training-induced muscle damage. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the attenuating effects of resistance training-induced muscle damage on endurance performance are influenced by exercise intensity, exercise mode, exercise sequence, recovery and contraction velocity of resistance training. By understanding the influence that training variables have on the level of resistance training-induced muscle damage and its subsequent attenuating effects on endurance performance, concurrent training programs could be prescribed in such a way that minimises fatigue between modes of training and optimises the quality of endurance training sessions. Therefore, this review will provide considerations for concurrent training prescription for endurance development based on scientific evidence. Furthermore, recommendations will be provided for future research by identifying training variables that may impact on endurance development as a result of concurrent training.

Purpose: The authors evaluated the effect of training-intensity distribution on anaerobic power as a substitute for 1500-m speed-skating performance in the 4 y leading up to an Olympic gold medal. Methods: During the preparation phase of the speed-skating season, anaerobic power was recorded periodically (n = 15) using the mean power (in watts) with a 30-s Wingate test. For each training session in the 4 wk prior to each Wingate test, the volume (in hours), training type (specific, simulation, nonspecific, and strength training), and the rating of perceived exertion (RPE; CR-10) were recorded. Results: Compared with the 8 lowest, the 7 highest-scoring tests were preceded by a significantly (P <.01) higher volume of strength training. Furthermore, the RPE distribution of the number of nonspecific training sessions was significantly different (P <.01). Significant (P <.05) correlations highlighted that a larger nonspecific training volume in the lower intensities RPE 2 (r =.735) and 3 (r =.592) was associated positively and the medium intensities RPE 4 (r = −.750) and 5 (r = −.579) negatively with Wingate performance. Conclusion: For the subject, the best results were attained with a high volume of strength training and the bulk of nonspecific training at RPE 2 and 3, and specifically not at the adjoining RPE 4 and 5. These findings are surprising given the aerobic nature of training at RPE 2 and 3 and the importance of anaerobic capacity in this middle-distance event.

Generally, resistance exercise results in an increase in muscle mass, and endurance exercise results in an increase in muscle capillary density, mitochondrial protein, fatty acid-oxidation enzymes, and more metabolically efficient forms of contractile and regulatory proteins. In the 25 yr since Hickson's initial description, there have been a number of important advances in the understanding of the molecular regulation of muscle's adaptation to exercise that may enable explanation of this phenomenon at the molecular level. As will be described in depth in the following four papers, two serine/threonine protein kinases in particular play a particularly important role in this process. Protein kinase B/Akt can both activate protein synthesis and decrease protein breakdown, thus leading to hypertrophy, and AMP-activated protein kinase can increase mitochondrial protein, glucose transport, and a number of other factors that result in an endurance phenotype. Not only are PKB and AMPK central to the generation of the resistance and endurance phenotypes, they also block each other's downstream signaling. The consequence of these interactions is a direct molecular blockade hindering the development of the concurrent training phenotype. A better understanding of the activation of these molecular pathways after exercise and how they interact will allow development of better training programs to maximize both strength and endurance.

Limited research on different interventions as kumite versus kata on anaerobic and aerobic responses and karate training improving balance. Specific karate skills as punch power, punch movement time and punch reaction time in terms of factors predicting performance have been rarely evaluated. Research aim integrated approaches of multivariate classification and multiple regression to evaluate motor fitness, both specific to karate and general to differentiate karate ability, as well as to identify motor factors predicting karate specific skill as reverse punch performance. METHODS: Twelve elite male athletes, black belt or higher, competing nationally and internationally and twelve novice male athletes practicing karate for less than one year, green belt or lower, volunteered for the study. A two group design enables application of multivariate classification to predict group membership. General motor tests represent a cross-section of motor abilities as Margaria-Kalamen power test, standing long jump, isometric grip strength, sit-reach flexibility, arm crank, peak aerobic power, anaerobic Wingate power test, time to peak power, mean power and power/weight. Karate specific motor tests reflected karate motor abilities. Specifically, karate agility, reverse power punch, reverse speed punch, reverse punch response time and lower limb bilateral flexibility. RESULTS: Classification analyses indicated stepwise discriminant analysis identified balance and Margaria-Kalamen test as the most important differences (accuracy 87.5%); binary logistic regression forward conditional identified balance, Margaria- Kalamen, arm crank and kumite sparring heart rate (accuracy 100%); neural network multilayer perceptron identified arm crank, speed punch, flexibility, mean power Wingate (accuracy 100%) and neural network radial basis function identified arm crank, Wingate mean power and karate flexibility (accuracy 100%). The regression analyses indicated punch power = .067(mean power) + 2.45(balance) + 22.54 (R²=.486: p=.001); punch speed = -.002(mean power) + 1.35 (R²=.359: p=.002) and punch response time = .009(karate agility test) + 0.16 (R²=.300: p=.006). DISCUSSION: Classification methods identified different factors contributing to karate skill level (elite and novice) with 87.5%-100% accuracy. These were balance, Margaria-Kalamen test, arm crank, kumite heart rate, speed punch, flexibility, Wingate mean power and karate flexibility. Differences indicate motor fitness training requirements to develop motor fitness profiles of elite karate athletes. The predictions of punch power by balance and Wingate mean power; punch speed by Wingate mean power; and punch response time by agility indicate reverse punch is influenced by previously nonidentified fitness factors. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Apply specific training based on learning a primary movement task is acquired more efficiently by this method and specific to competition for strength, power, speed, direction of movement and range of movements. Resistance cables, which permit specific movements, are applied to develop strength, power and speed. Secondary adjunctive training should focus on triaxial balance, alactic power, lactic power, arm crank ability, speed punch, karate specific flexibility and aerobic power.

This problem is of paramount importance for the theory of training and for all aspects of its application in practice. Ultimately, training transfer determines how useful or useless each given exercise is for the targeted athletic performance. The methodological background of training transfer encompasses basic concepts related to transfer modality, i.e., positive, neutral, and negative; the generalization of training responses and their persistence over time; factors affecting training transfer such as personality, motivation, social environment, etc. Training transfer in sport is clearly differentiated with regard to the enhancement of motor skills and the development of motor abilities. The studies of bilateral skill transfer have shown cross-transfer effects following one-limb training associated with neural adaptations at cortical, subcortical, spinal, and segmental levels. Implementation of advanced sport technologies such as motor imagery, biofeedback, and exercising in artificial environments can facilitate and reinforce training transfer from appropriate motor tasks to targeted athletic performance. Training transfer of motor abilities has been studied with regard to contralateral effects following one limb training, cross-transfer induced by arm or leg training, the impact of strength/power training on the preparedness of endurance athletes, and the impact of endurance workloads on strength/power performance. The extensive research findings characterizing the interactions of these workloads have shown positive transfer, or its absence, depending on whether the combinations conform to sport-specific demands and physiological adaptations. Finally, cross-training as a form of concurrent exercising in different athletic disciplines has been examined in reference to the enhancement of general fitness, the preparation of recreational athletes, and the preparation of athletes for multi-sport activities such as triathlon, duathlon, etc. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=89219559&site=ehost-live"

Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto controls (WKY) were submitted to training or kept sedentary (S) for 3 months. After functional recordings, brain was removed and processed for autoradiography (brain stem sequential slices hybridized with (35)S-oligodeoxynucleotide probes for angiotensinogen [Aogen] and angiotensin II type 1 [AT(1A)] receptors). Resting arterial pressure and heart rate were higher in SHR(S) (177+/-2 mm Hg, 357+/-12 bpm versus 121+/-1 mm Hg, 320+/-9 bpm in WKY(S); P<0.05). Training was equally effective to enhance treadmill performance and to cause resting bradycardia (-10%) in both groups. Training-induced blood pressure fall (-6.3%) was observed only in SHR(T). In SHR(S) (versus WKY(S)) AT(1A) and Aogen mRNA expression were significantly increased within the NTS and area postrema (average of +67% and +41% for AT(1A) and Aogen, respectively; P<0.05) but unchanged in the gracilis nucleus. Training did not change AT(1A) expression but reduced NTS and area postrema Aogen mRNA densities specifically in SHR(T) (P<0.05 versus SHR(S), with values within the range of WKY groups). In SHRs, NTS Aogen mRNA expression was correlated with resting pressure (y=5.95x +41; r=0.55; P<0.05), with no significant correlation in the WKY group. Concurrent training-induced reductions of both Aogen mRNA expression in brain stem cardiovascular-controlling areas and mean arterial pressure only in SHRs suggest that training is as efficient as the renin-angiotensin blockers to reduce brain renin-angiotensin system overactivity and to decrease arterial pressure.

A total of 32 postpuberty obese adolescents were submitted to aerobic training (AT) and resistance training (RT) for 14 weeks. The subjects were divided into linear periodization (LP, n = 16) or daily undulating periodization (DUP, n = 16). Body composition, visceral and subcutaneous fat, glycemia, insulinemia, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles, blood pressure, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), resting metabolic rate (RMR), muscular endurance were analyzed at baseline and after intervention. Both groups demonstrated a significant reduction in body mass, BMI, body fat, visceral and subcutaneous fat, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure and an increase in fat-free mass, VO2max, and muscular endurance. However, only DUP promoted a reduction in insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR. It is important to emphasize that there was no statics difference between LP and DUP groups; however, it appears that there may be bigger changes in the DUP than LP group in some of the metabolic syndrome risk factors in obese adolescents with regard to the effect size (ES). Both periodization models presented a large effect on muscular endurance. Despite the limitation of sample size, our results suggested that the ACE genotype may influence the functional and metabolic characteristics of obese adolescents and may be considered in the future strategies for massive obesity control.

For that, 26 articles were selected in PubMed, SciELO, LILACS and in Google Scholar that studied its chronic effect in adult humans. After analyzing these studies, it was verified that the samples used were in both sexes, with a quantitative of 12 to 50 volunteers. The training period ranged from 7 to 21 weeks with a weekly frequency of 2 to 6 days per week. None of the studies used a specific diet or reported the use of supplementation by participants during interventions. Regarding the types of training, it was observed that the CT is capable of maintaining or improving body composition, reducing fat percentage and increasing lean mass. The same occurred in relation to VO2max, as well as endurance training. Regarding the maximum force, all the studies presented a significant increase after the accomplishment of the CT and the Strength Training (ST), but in high speeds, as in the power, in some cases only the initial values were maintained for the CT and the increase in ST. Although CT may not be compatible with the development of potency, when discussing its health-related benefits, it has been shown to be effective.

In addition, it is related to the incidence of many chronic diseases in adult and old age. Because of that, different forms of exercise training are today included in public health recommendations. For many years these recommendations were limited to aerobic and flexibility exercises, but today resistance exercise training is recognized as a powerful tool for health improvements. During the aging process significant reductions in muscle mass and muscle strength occur (sarcopenia). This reduction is visible in slow-twich and fast-twich muscle fibers, as well as in muscle cross-sectional area. The metabolic effects of reduced muscle mass lead to a high prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension. These risk factors are associated with abnormalities in cardiovascular structures and function. There is a large body of scientific evidence suggesting that resistance training prevents the loss of muscle mass and function when the mechanical stimuli provided by common tasks of daily living are not sufficient to offset aging declines. The increase in muscle mass may reduce multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors. Older people are probably a part of society that could profit the most from resistance training. Aerobic training as well as flexibility exercises can be suggested, but it has to be kept in mind that only resistance training can produce hypertrophy of muscles and strength gains. Enhanced strength in the elderly provides better functional capacity as well as independence, and leads to a greater overall quality of live. Bearing in mind the significant positive health effects of aerobic training, probably the best recommendation for elderly would be to combine resistance training with aerobic training.

Rogge’ aims to systematically review muscle activity and muscle fatigue during sustained submaximal quasi-isometric knee extension exercise (hiking) related to Olympic dinghy sailing as a tribute to Dr Rogge’s merits in the world of sports. Dr Jacques Rogge is not only the former President of the International Olympic Committee, he was also an orthopaedic surgeon and a keen sailor, competing at three Olympic Games. In 1972, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Sports Medicine, he was the first who studied a sailors’ muscle activity by means of invasive needle electromyography (EMG) during a specific sailing technique (hiking) on a self-constructed sailing ergometer. Hiking is a bilateral and multi-joint submaximal quasi-isometric movement which dinghy sailors use to optimize boat speed and to prevent the boat from capsizing. Large stresses are generated in the anterior muscles that cross the knee and hip joint, mainly employing the quadriceps at an intensity of 30–40% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), sometimes exceeding 100% MVC. Better sailing level is partially determined by a lower rate of neuromuscular fatigue during hiking and for ≈60% predicted by a higher maximal isometric quadriceps strength. Although useful in exercise testing, prediction of hiking endurance capacity based on the changes in surface EMG in thigh and trunk muscles during a hiking maintenance task is not reliable. This could probably be explained by the varying exercise intensity and joint angles, and the great number of muscles and joints involved in hiking. Highlights Dr Jacques Rogge, former president of the International Olympic Committee and Olympic Finn sailor, was the first to study muscle activity during sailing using invasive needle EMG to obtain his Master degree in Sports Medicine at the Ghent University.Hiking is a critical bilateral and multi-joint movement during dinghy racing, accounting for >60% of the total upwind leg time. Hiking generates large stresses in the anterior muscles that cross the knee and hip joint.Hiking is considered as a quasi-isometric bilateral knee extension exercise. Muscle activity measurements during sailing, recorded by means of EMG, show a mean contraction intensity of 30-40% maximal voluntary contraction with peaks exceeding 100%.Hiking performance is strongly related to the development of neuromuscular fatigue in the quadriceps muscle. Since maximal strength is an important determinant of neuromuscular fatigue during hiking, combined strength and endurance training should be incorporated in the training program of dinghy sailors.

During aerobic exercise the adipose tissue triglycerides must be hydrolyzed in resultant fatty acids and glycerol delivered to the blood and posterior muscular tissue. The aim of this paper is to describe if resistance training before aerobic training alters lipid mobilization from adipose tissue. Materials and Methods: Participated of the study (COMEP n. 03455/2008) an individual of the female sex, with 24 years of age, body mass index (BMI)=19.2kg.m-2 and aerobic capacity (VO2max)=39mL.kg-1.min-1. The subject was submitted to two experimental protocols for evaluate the level of triglycerides oxidation. In the first day, the subject was submitted to an aerobic exercise (40%VO2max) after resistance training (anaerobic). After 48h, was submitted only to aerobic exercise. The lactate was analyzed in rest, during aerobic and anaerobic exercise. The glycerol was dosed in rest and immediately to end aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Results: The results showed major blood lactate and triglycerides mobilization (30%) when the subject was submitted to prolonged aerobic exercise realized after muscular resistance protocol. Discussion: A better understanding of lipid mobilization regulation will facilitate the development of more effective treatment modalities for obesity-related metabolic disorders.

Twelve weeks of: three 1-hour sessions per week of moderate-intensity water-based circuit training exercise with alternating aerobic and resistance stations (WEX); three 1-hour sessions per week of moderate-intensity gym-based circuit training exercise (GEX); or continuing usual activities (control). Aerobic capacity (VO 2peak), upper and lower limb one repetition maximum strength (biceps curl, latissimus dorsi pulldown, hamstring curl and leg press), anthropometry (weight, body mass index and girth) and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Forty-five participants completed the study (WEX n = 15, GEX n = 18, control n = 12). Both training groups significantly improved VO 2peak compared with control: WEX by 2.5 ml/kg/min (95% CI 0.6 to 4.4) and GEX by 2.3 ml/kg/min (95% CI 0.6 to 4.0). WEX and GEX improved hamstring strength compared with control: WEX by 6.3 kg (95% CI 1.2 to 11.3) and GEX by 7.6 kg (95% CI 2.9 to 12.2). Compared with control, GEX increased leg press strength by 15.5 kg (95% CI 5.7 to 25.3), whereas the effect of WEX was less clear (MD 7.1 kg, 95% CI –3.5 to 17.7).

There were negligible between-group differences in weight or waist circumference. WEX was well tolerated and improved aerobic capacity, leg strength and body fat to a similar degree as GEX in people with coronary heart disease.

IG Anxiety and Depression decreased POST and did not change until T24. IG C-reactive protein decreased POST and increased to pre-exercise levels T24. CG immunological/inflammatory/life quality markers did not change. Six weeks of HIT/HIRT by breast cancer patients can induce similar beneficial effects like two years of convalescence, but outcomes were unstable and showed a fast backslide in aerobic capacity, activity level and in pro-inflammatory state within 12 months. High-intensity interval endurance and strength training (HIT/HIRT) for female breast cancer patients was shown to improve psychological well-being and performance, but long-term effects/adherence are unknown. Significant backslides in aerobic capacity, activity level as well as in the pro-inflammatory response after one and two years are observed and should be monitored. Continuous supervision and/or support of breast cancer patients before, during, and after medical care due to poor training adherence when voluntarily executed is recommended.

Recent consensus documents, position stands, and reports were used to provide reference definitions and methods of classifying physical activity and exercise. The two principal categories of physical activity are occupational physical activity (OPA) and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA). OPA is usually referenced to an 8h d, whereas the duration of LTPA is quite variable. LTPA includes all forms of aerobic activities, structured endurance exercise programs, resistance-training programs, and sports. Energy expenditure associated with aerobic activity can be expressed in absolute terms (kJ.min-1), referenced to body mass (METs), or relative to some maximal physiological response (i.e., maximal heart rate (HR) or aerobic power (VO2max)). The net cost of physical activity should be used to express energy expenditure relative to dose-response issues. The intensity of resistance training is presented in terms relative to the greatest weight that can be lifted one time in good form (1RM). The intensity of OPA followed the guidance of a previous consensus conference. The intensity of most LTPA can be categorized using the standard aerobic exercise classifications; however, for long-duration (2 + hours) LTPA, the classifications for OPA may be more appropriate. Physical activities should be classified in a consistent and standardized manner in terms of both energy expenditure and the relative effort required.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=sph&AN=SPHS-780685&site=ehost-live"

The focus of this study was to investigate the feasibility of tyre-pulling as a strength and endurance training exercise. Methods: Thirty-four volunteered participants accepted to comply with an 8-week training program, and were by drawing lots divided into three groups: long-distance training, high-intensity interval training and control groups. The long-distance group exercised 60 min at 75–85% of HRmax three times a week. The high-intensity interval group also exercised three times a week with 10 intervals of 20 s and a rest of 10 s in an all-out intensity. The control group continued their ordinary activities. A test battery, measuring arm and leg strength, core strength, and endurance, were taken at the beginning and after 8 weeks. Anthropometric measurements and spirometry test were performed likewise. Results: The high-intensity group had increased maximal oxygen uptake by 2.6 (2.2) mL kg−1 min−1. The number of repetitions in arm strength increased with 4.2 (3.5), for leg strength, the increase was 7.9 (9.2) repetitions. Leg strength increased in the long-distance group with 13.6 (14.7) repetitions and core strength increased with 30.3 (34.0), p ≤ 0.05. No significant changes were observed in the control group. Conclusions: Tyre-pulling is feasible for training endurance and strength at both low and high intensities.

"Učinki vadbe moči in vzdržljivosti inspiratornih dihalnih mišic na telesno zmogljivost pripadnikov Specialne enote Slovenske vojske.","Tanšek, Monika Jeruc; Švent, Andrej; Kacin, Alan","Fizioterapija",="13182102",,="20191002","27",,"27","2","142402840",,,"Article",,,"Background: The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of the IMT with the POWERbreathe device on the members of Slovenian Armed Forces Special Unit. The load mass carrying on the chest wall limits the chest expansion, which increases the work of breathing. Because of the limited lung movement, the respiratory muscles are beyond the optimal limits of their longitudinal-tension curve. Such change in respiratory mechanics leads to an accelerated fatigue of the respiratory muscles that can worsen the capacity of the individual, by reducing blood flow to other skeletal muscles and increasing the perception of effort (1). The research conducted by Faghy and Brown (2) showed that this phenomenon can be successfully reduced by targeted training of the inspiratory muscles, but it is not clear what is the optimal respiratory resistance for the optimal effect of exercise. Methods: The volunteers from the Slovenian Armed Forces Special Unit were divided into two groups by lot. Introductory and final testing included: anthropometric measurements, fatigue tests for respiratory muscles, spirometry, and a walk test with a 25-kg backpack on the treadmill. For six weeks, the experimental group trained with the POWER breathe device with an initial resistance of 60% MIP, which gradually increased to 80% MIP. The control group exercised with the same device, but with sham respiratory resistance. The training protocol was the same for both groups. They trained every day of the week, twice a day with 30 consecutive maximum breaths with resistance that was pre-set on the device. Both groups were keeping the exercise diary. After completion of the exercise program, the subjects completed the final testing. The research was approved by the Medical Ethics Commission of the Republic of Slovenia, approval code 0120/494/2017. Results: The results of the study showed that there were statistically significant changes in time between the groups in the power of the inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscles, which is attributed to the effect of IMT. Also, there were statistically significant differences in time between the groups in tiredness of the inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscles before and after the walking test. The estimated aerobic capacity, heart rate at rest and during exercise, blood pressure, and subjective assessment of muscle and respiratory effort on the Borg scale did not statistically significantly change after training. Conclusions: The exercise of the inspiratory respiratory muscles with appropriate resistance improves the muscular strength of the respiratory muscles and reduces their fatigue. We estimate that significant differences in the measurements during the walking test were not detected due to the somewhat low intensity of the test used, which all participants performed without effort. Based on the results, we believe that IMT is appropriate for different groups of physically demanding occupations (e.g., field military services, firefighters, emergency medical services, etc.) as well as for individuals who wear backpacks in hiking activities (hikers, alpinists, mountain skiers, etc.).

However, evidence from aerobic exercise training suggests that early changes in functional LV wall mechanics may occur prior to and independently of changes in LV size, although short-term changes in LV mechanics and structural remodelling in response to RT protocols have not been reported. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of RT on LV mechanics in healthy men performing 2 different time-under-tension protocols. Forty recreationally trained men (age: 23 ± 3 years) were randomized into 12 weeks of whole-body higher-repetition RT (20–25 repetitions/set to failure at ∼30%–50% 1 repetition maximum (1RM); n = 13), lower-repetition RT (8–12 repetitions/set to failure at ∼75%–90% 1RM; n = 13), or an active control period (n = 14). Speckle tracking echocardiography was performed at baseline and following the intervention period. Neither RT program altered standard measures of LV volumes (end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, or ejection fraction; P > 0.05) or indices of LV mechanics (total LV twist, untwisting rate, twist-to-shortening ratio, untwisting-to-twist ratio, or longitudinal strain; P > 0.05). This is the first longitudinal study to assess both LV size and mechanics after RT in healthy men, suggesting a maintenance of LV size and twist mechanics despite peripheral muscle adaptations to the training programs. These results provide no evidence for adverse LV structural or functional remodelling in response to RT in young men and support the positive role of RT in the maintenance of optimal cardiovascular function, even with strenuous RT.

Sixteen well-trained athletes (17 ± 1 years, 60 ± 6 kg, 169 ± 6 cm, VO2max running: 60 ± 5 mL/kg/min) were assigned either to an intervention group ( INT; n = 9) or a control group ( CON; n = 7). INT completed two weekly sessions of upper body heavy strength training in a linear periodized fashion for 10 weeks. Both groups continued their normal aerobic endurance and muscular endurance training. One repetition maximum in seated pull-down increased significantly more in INT than in CON, with a group difference of 15 ± 8% ( P < 0.01). Performance, expressed as average power output on a double poling ergometer over 20 s and as 3 min with maximal effort in both rested (sprint-test) and fatigued states (finishing-test), showed similar changes in both groups. Submaximal O2- cost and VO2peak in double poling showed similar changes or were unchanged in both groups. In conclusion, 10 weeks of heavy strength training increased upper body strength but had trivial effects on performance in a double poling ergometer in junior female cross-country skiers.

The training consisted of sessions carried out for 20–30 mins, three times per week, at an intensity between the UB-Tvent and UB-RCP, and replaced part of a typical lower limb aerobic training whilst maintaining the usual weekly schedule of callisthenics, resistance training and sailing. Seven sailors, including four grinders and three mastmen (age 30 ± 5.5 years, height 1.9 ± 0.04 m, body mass 102 ± 3.6 kg), were evaluated through both an ACE cardiopulmonary maximal exercise test (CPET) and an ACE all-out up to exhaustion exercise test, before and after the ACE training. UB aerobic fitness improved significantly: UB- O2peak increased from 4.29 ± 0.442 to 4.52 ± 0.522 l·min−1 (6.4 ± 3.66%), O2 at UB-Tvent from 2.42 ± 0.282 to 2.97 ± 0.328 l·min−1 (22.8 ± 5.09%) and O2 at UB-RCP from 3.25 ± 0.402 to 3.75 ± 0.352 l·min−1 (16.1 ± 10.83%). Peak power at the ACE CPET increased from 351 ± 27.5 to 387 ± 33.5 W (10.5 ± 6.93%). The all-out test total mechanical work increased from 28.9 ± 2.35 to 40.1 ± 3.76 kJ (72.1 ± 4.67%). In conclusion, a high intensity aerobic ACE training can be effective in improving grinding performance by increasing UB aerobic fitness and all-out working capacity.

Outside of running long distances on a flat surface and power-lifting, practically all sports require some combination of endurance and strength. Endurance and strength can be developed simultaneously to some degree. However, the development of a high level of endurance seems to prohibit the development or maintenance of muscle mass and strength. This interaction between endurance and strength is called the concurrent training effect. This review specifically defines the concurrent training effect, discusses the potential molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, and proposes strategies to maximize strength and endurance in the high-level athlete.

For a long time it was believed that resistance training is not suitable for endurance athletes due to unwanted increases in muscle mass and training of muscle fibres that are not important for those athletes. Based on the literature review that we performed we conclude that resistance training positively affects numerous important determinants of endurance performance and that there are no downsides reported. Studies report that addition of resistance training can have possitive effects as only as 8 weeks after the onset of such training. Resistance training can thus very effectively contribute towards better performance provided that exercise is designed according to the needs of a discipline and the athlete. The main reasons for efficacy of resistance training appears to be improved movement efficiency, maximal locomotion speed, improvements of anaerobic capacity and concomitant delayed onset of fatigue.

There is also research that indicates playing styles can differ between Northern hemisphere (NH) and Southern hemisphere (SH) teams. It is not presently known if these variances in playing styles are reflected in the S and C practices of those supporting NH and SH teams. As such, the present study examines any variances in S and C practices between those supporting NH and SH elite-level teams. A validated questionnaire was employed that comprised 7 sections: personal details, physical testing, strength and power development, concurrent training, unique aspects of the program, and any further relevant information regarding prescribed training programs. Forty (20 NH, 20 SH, 38 males, 2 females; 33.0 ± 5.5 years) of 52 (77%) coaches responded to the questionnaire. All practitioners worked with international level or professional RU athletes. The primary variances in S and C practice between NH and SH coaches included utilization of differing tests of anaerobic capacity and cardiovascular endurance and differing prescription of compound and Olympic lifts. Also, NH coaches placed a greater emphasis on strength and power training, whereas SH coaches had a more objective approach to determining strength training loads. Furthermore, SH practitioners placed more emphasis on integration compared with NH practitioners. Other aspects of S and C practice detailed in this article appear to be similar between NH and SH practitioners. This research represents the only published survey to date of differing S and C practices in NH and SH RU.

Eighteen professional soccer players performed 17 training sessions and 1 friendly-match (FM) over the preseason. The internal TL was obtained using the session-rating of perceived exertion method. The external TL variables collected were total and high-intensity distances, body-load, and high-metabolic power distance via the GPS system. VJ performance was assessed 13 times throughout the study. Moreover, total quality recovery and delayed onset muscle soreness were assessed before every training session as a measure of recovery status. Players were divided, using a median split analysis, into two groups, according to their VJ performance (i.e., ""lower"" and ""higher"" VJ). External TL variables displayed similar variations across training sessions and were significantly interrelated (r ranging from 0.48 to 0.88). In periods where higher internal TLs were detected, impaired recovery status was noticed. Notably, the higher VJ group exhibited decreased jump performance at post-test and higher internal and external TLs across the entire preseason (compared to the lower VJ group). From our results it is suggested that professional soccer players with higher VJ performance are potentially more susceptible to concurrent training effects.

Eight endurance-trained (ET) and nine sedentary controls (SED) volunteered for this study. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals from a five-pin electrode array were recorded from the VL during isometric trapezoid muscle actions at 40% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Decomposition methods were applied to the EMG signals to extract the firing events and amplitudes of single MUs. The mean firing rate (MFR) during steady force and MUAPAMP for each MU was regressed against recruitment threshold (RT, expressed as %MVC). The y-intercepts and slopes from the MFR and MUAPAMP vs. RT relationships were calculated. EMG amplitude during steady force was normalized (N-EMGRMS) to peak EMG amplitude recorded during the MVC. Ultrasonography was used to measure mCSA and mEI. Significant differences existed between the ET and SED for the slopes (P = 0.005, P = 0.001) from the MFR and MUAPAMP vs. RT relationships with no differences for the y-intercepts (P > 0.05). N-EMGRMS was significantly (P = 0.033) lower for the ET than SED. There were no differences between groups for mCSA; however, the SED possessed significantly (P = 0.001) greater mEI. Subsequently, the ET likely possessed hypertrophied and stronger MUs that allowed for lower necessary muscle activation to maintain the same relative task as the SED. The larger MUs for the ET is supported via the MFR vs. RT relationships and ultrasound data.

Similarly, regular physical activity has also been shown to assist in preventing, and reducing the severity of these conditions. Many people, including athletes, acknowledge these findings and are adopting a vegetarian-based diet to improve their health status. Furthermore, athletes are incorporating this approach with the specific aim of optimizing physical performance. To examine the evidence for the relationship between consuming a predominately vegetarian-based diet and improved physical performance, a systematic literature review was performed using the SCOPUS database. No date parameters were set. The keywords vegetarian OR vegan AND sport OR athlete OR training OR performance OR endurance were used to identify relevant literature. Included studies (i) directly compared a vegetarian-based diet to an omnivorous/mixed diet, (ii) directly assessed physical performance, not biomarkers of physical performance, and (iii) did not use supplementation emulating a vegetarian diet. Reference lists were hand searched for additional studies. Seven randomized controlled trials and one cross-sectional study met the inclusion criteria. No distinguished differences between vegetarian-based diets and omnivorous mixed diets were identified when physical performance was compared. Consuming a predominately vegetarian-based diet did not improve nor hinder performance in athletes. However, with only 8 studies identified, with substantial variability among the studies' experimental designs, aims and outcomes, further research is warranted.

We examined the effects of elite powerlifting training upon ventilatory muscle strength, pulmonary function and diaphragm thickness in world-class powerlifters (POWER) and a control group (CON) with no history of endurance or resistance training, matched for age, height and body mass. Methods: Body composition was assessed using single-frequency bioelectrical impedance. Maximal static volitional inspiratory ( P) and expiratory ( P) mouth pressures, diaphragm thickness ( T) derived from ultrasound measurements and pulmonary function from maximal flow volume loops were measured. Results: There were no differences in physical characteristics or pulmonary function between groups. P (22 %, P < 0.05, effect size d = 1.13), P (16 %, P = 0.07, effect size d = 0.86) and T (27 %, P < 0.01, effect size d = 1.59) were greater in POWER than CON. Correlations were observed between both T and P ( r = 0.518, P < 0.05), T and P ( r = 0.671, P < 0.01) and T and body mass ( r = 0.502, P < 0.05). Conclusions: We conclude that manoeuvres performed by world-class powerlifters improve ventilatory muscle strength and increases diaphragm size. Whole-body resistance training may be an appropriate training mode to attenuate the effects of ventilatory muscle weakness experienced with ageing and some disease states.

Design: Pilot, exploratory, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Setting: University Hospital of Munich, Germany. Subjects: Twenty-three outpatients with Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage II–IV). Interventions: Patients received 12 training sessions within five weeks of either visual cues combined with treadmill training (n = 12) or pure treadmill training (n = 11). Main measures: Outcome measures were gait speed, stride length and cadence recorded on the treadmill. Functional tests included the Timed Up and Go Test, the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale and the Freezing of gait-questionnaire. Assessments were conducted at baseline, after the training period and at two months follow-up. Results: After the training period (n = 20), gait speed and stride length had increased in both groups (p ⩽ 0.05). Patients receiving the combined training scored better in the Timed Up and Go Test compared with the patients receiving pure treadmill training (p ⩽ 0.05). At two months follow-up (n = 13), patients who underwent the combined training sustained better results in gait speed and stride length (p ⩽ 0.05) and sustained the improvement in the Timed Up and Go Test (p ⩽ 0.05). Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that visual cues combined with treadmill training have more beneficial effects on gait than pure treadmill training in patients with a moderate stage of Parkinson’s disease.

This study determined the actual tennis serve volume in elite play and used these data to construct an interval training program based on stroke volume. Hypothesis: There will be no differences in serve volume between male and female tennis players at the professional and junior levels. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Methods: Game day statistic scorecards were provided to the research team from the 2013 and 2014 United States Open and the 2014 Metropolia Orange Bowl International Tennis Championships. Serve volume data for both male and female players were extracted from the scorecards. Data included serves per match and per set. These data were used to construct a sport-specific tennis program to meet the demands of the serve. Results: Professional male players serve 63 more serves per match than junior male players because of the greater number of sets played (P < 0.01). Professional female players serve 10 more serves per match than junior female players playing the same number of sets (P = 0.01). All male players hit 2 more total serves per set than all female players (P < 0.01). Regardless of sex, professional players serve 4 more serves per set than junior players (P < 0.01). The typical number of serves per set was 40 in elite-level tennis players, resulting in a 3:1 ratio of first to second serves. Conclusion: These data establish the “unit dose” of serves per match and/or per set for each group. Clinical Relevance: Coaches and health care providers may use these data in estimating loads per tournament/season and to prepare tennis athletes for individual competition and/or as they return to play after an injury.

Methods: Five typical water based exercises (WE) of known intensity were utilized during the classes; intensity ranged from 'moderate' to 'hard' according to ACSM criteria (RPE range 12-14). Results: The group physical activity level and food intake were not significantly different before and after training. A significant decrease for the skin folds sum (−4.6 %) and for %fat mass (−3.8 %) calculated according to skin folds technique was found after training. DXA regional data showed a significant increase in the fat-free mass of arms (2.4 %) and trunk (0.9 %). According to the Astrand step test, the training program led to an increase of estimated maximal oxygen uptake (14.9 %) and a decrease in sub-maximal Heart Rate (−6.9 %). A significant change in the majority of the physical capacities tested was found: abdominal and upper body muscular endurance (21 and 36 %, respectively), leg flexors and extensors maximal strength (12 and 8 %, respectively) as well as balance (34 %) all improved after training ( p < 0.05) Conclusions: A training program based on WE of known intensity and tailored to the ACSM recommendations can significantly improve cardio respiratory fitness, muscular endurance, strength, balance and some aspects of body composition in active young adult women.

Training during adolescence may influence the myocardium1s adaptation. Effects of exercise training on left ventricular function differ depending whether they result from pressure or volume overload. Accordingly, the present study was designed to examine, by echocardiography studies, the effects of endurance versus weight lifting training modes on left ventricular contractility in healthy adolescent boys. Methods. Sixty healthy adolescent boys were randomly and evenly divided into 3 groups: weightlifting training, run-training, and control. Exercising groups underwent 28-week training programs, 3-4 times a week, 35 min each session. The weight lifting program for consisted of training on 6 dynamic resistive machines at resistance corresponding to 6-repetition maximum. The running program was composed of aerobic exercise training at 65 % of their VO2max. Results. At rest, only in the runners end diastolic volume and end systolic pressure-volume ratio differed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) from pre- to post-testing. During post-testing session at peak exercise, runners compared to weightlifters demonstrated improvement respectively in: wall stress (245 +/- 42 and 290 +/- 35 103 dyn.cm2), end systolic pressure-volume ratio (7.2 +/- .7 and 6.4 +/- .5 ratio) and ejection fraction (82 +/- 5 % and 76 +/- 5 %). Maximal oxygen uptake (48.2 +/- 3.2 and 43.8 +/- 3.5 mL.kg-1.min-1), also improved significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Maximal load was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the runners and weight lifters than in the control group with significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher values for the weight lifters than runners. Conclusion. This study has showed that in adolescent boys the mode of exercise training leads to significant differences in left ventricular function and contractility, related to differences in volume-after-load relationship and not to fundamental differences in the properties of the myocardium.

Purpose: Excess fat mass (FM) contributes to poor prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis and comorbidity. However, FM gain is a common side effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We examined the efficacy of a 12-wk weight loss intervention to reduce FM and maintain lean mass (LM) in ADT-treated obese PCa patients. Methods: Fourteen ADT-treated obese PCa patients (72 ± 9 yr, 39.7% ± 5.4% body fat) were recruited for a self-controlled prospective study, with 11 completing the 6-wk control period, followed by a 12-wk intervention comprising 300 min·wk−1 of exercise including supervised resistance training and home-based aerobic exercise, and dietitian consultations advising a daily energy deficit (2100–4200 kJ) and protein supplementation. Body composition was assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included muscle strength (one-repetition maximum), cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen consumption), and blood biomarkers. Results: There were no significant changes during the control period. Patients attended 89% of supervised exercise sessions and 100% of dietitian consultations. No changes in physical activity or energy intake were observed. During the intervention, patients experienced significant reductions in weight (−2.8 ± 3.2 kg, P = 0.016), FM (−2.8 ± 2.6 kg, P < 0.001), and trunk FM (−1.8 ± 1.4 kg, P < 0.001), with LM preserved (−0.05 ± 1.6 kg, P = 0.805). Muscle strength (4.6%–24.7%, P < 0.010) and maximal oxygen consumption (3.5 ± 4.7 mL·min−1·kg−1, P = 0.041) significantly improved. Leptin significantly decreased (−2.2 (−2.7 to 0.5) ng·mL−1, P = 0.016) with no other changes in blood biomarkers such as testosterone and lipids (P = 0.051–0.765); however, C-reactive protein (r s = −0.670, P = 0.024) and triglycerides (r = −0.667, P = 0.025) were associated with individual changes in LM. Conclusions: This study shows preliminary efficacy for an exercise and nutrition weight loss intervention to reduce FM, maintain LM, and improve muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness in ADT-treated obese PCa patients. The change in body composition may affect blood biomarkers associated with obesity and PCa progression; however, further research is required.

Physical prehabilitation programs aim to prepare patients for surgery by improving their functional status with the aim of reducing postoperative complications. This systematic review aims to summarize the effects of physical prehabilitation programs on exercise capacity, muscle strength, respiratory muscle function, postoperative outcomes, and health-related quality of life and to determine the optimal design of such a program to improve these outcomes in esophagogastric cancer patients undergoing tumor resection. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, and PEDro databases to identify studies evaluating the effects of physical prehabilitation program on exercise capacity, muscle strength, respiratory muscle function, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, mortality, and health-related quality of life in patients with esophagogastric cancer awaiting surgery. Data from all studies meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted. The quality of each selected study was determined using the Downs and Black checklist. Results: Seven studies with 645 participants were included. The preoperative exercise program consisted of respiratory training alone in three studies, a combination of aerobic and resistance training in two studies, and a combination of respiratory, aerobic, and resistance training in two studies. Training frequency ranged from three times a day to twice a week and each session lasted between 20 and 75 min. Four studies were of fair quality and three of good quality. Some studies reported improvements in maximal inspiratory pressure, inspiratory muscle endurance, postoperative (pulmonary) complications, and length of hospital stay in the preoperative exercise group compared to the control group. Conclusion: This systematic review reports the current evidence for physical prehabilitation programs in patients with esophagogastric cancer awaiting surgery. However, due to the limited number of randomized controlled trials, the significant heterogeneity of exercise programs, and the questionable quality of the studies, higher quality randomized controlled trials are needed.

Muscle training is also an important component of rehabilitation to limit atrophy associated with immobilization, aging, or disease. To optimize exercise interventions, a good understanding of the response to various training programs and the identification of the mechanisms that influence muscle function are required. Changes in the performance of muscle contraction are associated, among other things, with muscle fiber-type expression and functional properties of the contractile apparatus. Chemically skinned, single fibers is the only model that allows study of the mechanical properties of human muscle fibers as a function of the expression of myosin heavy-chain isoforms. Recently, this model has been used to explore the functional adaptations after different types of solicitations. The current results of the literature indicate that cross-sectional area and force of a specific fiber type are enhanced after resistance training, whereas maximal unloaded shortening velocity is increased by endurance training. Plyometric training improves both fiber force and shortening velocity. Fiber peak power is increased after resistance or plyometric training, and on a long-term basis it is decreased after endurance training. Studies on elderly individuals indicate that this population may react differently with respect to some single-fiber adaptations after training. Generally, training regimens tend to decrease the proportion of type IIx fibers. The available data in the literature make it possible to formulate recommendations applicable to sport science and rehabilitation.

J Strength Cond Res 36(10): 2927–2933, 2022—Comparisons between sexes of adaptive responses with concurrent aerobic and resistance exercise training are largely unexplored. A supervised 12-week intervention of concurrent exercise training was used to investigate sex-specific differences, if any, in the response to concurrent exercise training in older adults. Community-dwelling men (n = 14; 68.0 ± 1.8 years; 27.8 ± 3.8 kg·m−2) and women (n = 14; 68.9 ± 3.8 years; 25.1 ± 3.8 kg·m−2) were pair-matched for relative leg strength expressed as leg press 1 repetition maximum per kg of leg lean body mass (LBM; assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). Subjects undertook 24 minutes of concurrent aerobic (12 minutes) and resistance (12 minutes) exercise training 3 times per week i.e., 72 minutes of active exercise time per week. Muscle strength, physical function, and body composition were assessed before (PRE) and after 12 weeks (POST) of exercise training. The increase in absolute leg press strength was larger in men (mean difference ± SE , 25.3 ± 11.8 kg; p = 0.041, η p 2 = 0.156), but when expressed as leg press strength relative to leg LBM, training-induced increases were not different between the sexes (mean difference ± SE , 0.30 ± 0.46 kg·kg−1; p = 0.526, η p 2 = 0.016). No other measure of muscle strength (hand-grip and chest press), physical function (gait speed, timed-up-and-go, sit-to-stand, and Chester step test), or body composition (LBM and fat mass) differed in response to exercise training for between-sex comparisons. When male and female older adults are pair matched for relative leg strength at baseline before commencing exercise training, sex-specific adaptive responses to concurrent aerobic and resistance exercise training are largely similar for muscle strength, physical function, and body composition.

On this basis proper training exercises and methods could be designed. Rock climbing has a variable character of the workload, includes many sub disciplines and demands complex development of the motor abilities. Different types of climbing vary in intensity, duration, methods used for protection and terrain. This may set different physical, mental and technical demands and may induce different physiological responses. Nevertheless, the performance limiting factors and training methods may be considered identical. Only the levels and proportions of development of the decisive abilities would be different. A very important characteristic of the workload in climbing is that more than one third of the ascent time is spend in immobilized positions. Climbing involves also sustained intermittent isometric contractions. These characteristics largely explain the nonstandard physiological responses. One unique physiological response is that heart rate disproportionally rises in comparison to oxygen consumption and heart rate could not be used for training guidance. Among the main training goals in rock climbing are: sport-specific strength and strength endurance of the forearm flexors, explosive strength of the arm flexors, strength endurance of the shoulder girdle and core maximal strength. Sport-specific strength is commonly developed through bouldering, hanging on fingerboards, exercising on campus boards and system training. Bouldering as a sport-specific exercise is highly effective for developing strength in unity with sports technique. However, the necessary training load cannot always be achieved due to difficulties of coordinative nature. Thus, special-preparatory strength exercises are widely used. Fingerboard hanging can enhance maximal strength and intramuscular coordination. Campus board training is a proven in the practice extraordinary tool for developing explosive strength, improving rate of force development, as well as intramuscular and intermuscular coordination. System training is a special form of strength training used to improve mainly intramuscular coordination. For endurance training mostly interval methods for developing aerobic and anaerobic capabilities are used in the form of long bouldering or traversing, top rope and lead climbing. As rock climbing has a variable character and many climbing conditions are possible (i.e. route length and inclination, holds' sizes, shapes and situation) it is difficult to standardize training and testing, to evaluate the performance limiting factors and to uncover workload control indicators. Nevertheless, the profound knowledge on different aspects of rock climbing is a precondition for enhancing performance through designing effective training methods which should highly reflect specificity to climbing.

That effect depends mostly on a type of exercise (resistance or endurance) and on a diet composition during the post exercise recovery. Resistance exercise promotes mainly myofibrillar protein synthesis. The largest elevation in the protein synthesis is observed during the first 3-4h of the recovery (so called ""anabolic window"") and decreases with time. Protein supplementation markedly increases the protein synthesis. The most potent activator of the process is leucine, a branched-chain aminoacid. Leucine is an independent stimulator of the synthesis. The protein synthesis stimulation may reach the maximal rate at a certain level of leucine in the myocytes. This level is called ""leucine threshold"". The post resistance exercise muscle protein synthesis is also regulated by hormones (testosterone, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1) and by local factors. There is a growing number of data indicating that mechano-growth factor is the most important local factor. It is generated during contractile activity of the muscle and promotes myofibrillar protein synthesis. The resistance training leads to hypertrophy of the muscles. The endurance exercise increases synthesis mostly mitochondrial proteins. Endurance training increases biogenesis of mitochondria and activity of the enzymes of the respiratory complex. The resistance exercise also activates muscle and tendon collagen synthesis. This process is controlled by growth hormone and by peptides produced locally by fibroblasts.

Methods and structure of the study. The concentrations of testosterone, cortisol, prolactin, follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones in the judokas of the republic of Adygea were studied by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA ""Vector-Best"", Russia). The tests were carried out during the training cycle after the rehabilitation period (1st point - basal level) and at the end of the 2-day intensive combined training (2nd point). The hormone concentration ratios were determined by means of Pearson correlation analysis as part of the software package SPSS Statistics 17.0. Examined contingent: the group of athletes (n=12) was represented by highly qualified judokas (Masters of Sport, multiple prize winners of the Russian Cup, CIS Championship, European Cup, European Judo Championship), training on the base of the Institute of Physical Education and Judo of Adyghe State University, Republic of Adygea (Maykop) in the tradition of the Olympic Judo Reserve School (coach B.A. Nepso). The Control Group (CG) (n=12) was picked up empirically from the non-sporting unrelated donors aged 18-21 years. Results and conclusions. The original hormonal profiles of the donors and judokas did not differ statistically significantly and did not exceed the standard values. After intensive trainings, the concentrations of stress hormone cortisol (p≤0.05) and testosterone (p≤0.05) increased, while those of luteinizing hormones, folliclestimulating hormones, and prolactin decreased. Changes in the hormonal profile of the qualified judokas within the physiological values indicated a high degree of adaptation of their body to physical loads during training activities.

Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the effect of two-month concurrent training (RT+HIIT) and caloric restriction on serum CRP and P65 amount in Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of inactive middle-aged men. Methods: Twenty-four inactive, healthy men participated in three homogeneous groups: Caloric restriction (CR), Concurrent training (T) and Concurrent training with Caloric restriction (CRT) groups. Calorie restriction and energy cost in five days a week was about six kcal•kg-1•day-1. The concurrent training was included five days per week (two sessions of resistance training with 75 to 80% 1RM and three sessions of high intensity interval training with 80-85% heart rate reserve). Baseline and post-intervention p65 in the total and phosphorylated (p-p65) levels in PBMCs were assessed by ELISA. Serum CRP concentration was also measured using immunoturbidimetric. Results: Weight loss in CRT group was significantly higher than the other two groups (P < 0.05). However, the changes range in fat percentage, maximal oxygen consumption and one-repetition maximum (1RM) of T and CRT groups were significantly higher than CR group (P < 0.05). Changes in phosphorylated P65 and p-p65 / total p65 ratio in PBMCs of T and CRT groups were significantlyhigher than CR group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Based on the present results, two months of concurrent training and caloric restriction can reduce some of inflammatory markers in inactive men. In addition, the effect of concurrent training with and without calorie restriction on the initiators of inflammatory factors is greater than the calorie restriction intervention alone. Therefore, concurrent training and caloric restriction are recommended for prevention and confronting obesity and its inflammatory consequences, especially in middle age.
