### Abstract 

Background: Many sports require maximal strength and endurance performance. Concurrent strength and endurance training can lead to suboptimal training adaptations. However, how adaptations differ between males and females is currently unknown. Also, current training status may affect training adaptations. Objective: To assess sex-specific differences in adaptations in strength, power, muscle hypertrophy and maximal oxygen consumption (V ̇O2max) to concurrent strength and endurance training in healthy adults. Secondly, we investigated how training adaptations are influenced by strength and endurance training status. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, and a Cochrane risk of bias was evaluated. ISI Web of science, PubMed/MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus databases were searched using the following inclusion criteria: healthy adults aged 18-50 years, intervention period of ≥4 weeks, and outcome measures were defined as upper- and lower-body strength, power, hypertrophy and/or V ̇O2max. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model and reported in standardized mean differences. Results: In total, 59 studies with 1,346 participants were included. Concurrent training showed blunted lower-body strength adaptations in males, but not in females (males: −0.43, CI95% [−0.64 to −0.22], females: 0.08 [−0.34 to 0.49], group difference: P=0.03). No sex differences were observed for changes in upper-body strength (P=0.67), power (P=0.37) or V ̇O2max (P=0.13). Data on muscle hypertrophy were insufficient to draw any conclusions. For training status, untrained but not trained or highly-trained endurance athletes displayed lower V ̇O2max gains with concurrent training (P=0.04). For other outcomes, no differences were found between untrained and trained individuals, both for strength and endurance training status. Conclusion: Concurrent training results in small interference for lower-body strength adaptations in males, but not in females. Untrained, but not trained or highly-trained endurance athletes demonstrated impaired improvements in V ̇O2max following concurrent training. More studies on females and highly strength- and endurance-trained athletes are warranted. ([PROSPERO: CRD42022370894](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/Prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=370894)).

### 

The aim of this study was to assess sex-specific differences in adaptations to concurrent strength and endurance training for strength, power, muscle hypertrophy and V ̇O2max in healthy adults. Secondly, we investigated how adaptations to concurrent training depend on strength and endurance training status. Such a systematic review and meta-analysis not only provides more insight into the concurrent training effects of various populations, but also highlights which populations may be underrepresented in the concurrent training literature.
